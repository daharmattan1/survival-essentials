## Buying Strategy

### Buy Quality Where It Matters
**Invest in**:
- Multi-tool (use it constantly)
- Knife (safety critical)
- Headlamp (you need it to work)
- Water filter (life-or-death)
- Fire starter (cold kills)

### Buy Budget Where It Doesn't
**Save money on**:
- Emergency blankets (they all work)
- Paracord (550 spec is 550 spec)
- Duct tape (it's all the same)
- Batteries (bulk Costco/Amazon)

### Watch For Sales
- **REI garage sales**: Returned gear (60-80% off)
- **Black Friday**: Outdoor gear heavily discounted
- **End of season**: Camping gear clearance
- **Military surplus**: Quality, durable, cheap

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Buying cheap multi-tools** - They break when you need them
2. **Forgetting batteries** - Gear is useless without power
3. **Not testing gear** - Find problems at home, not in emergency
4. **Over-packing bug-out bag** - Can't carry 50 lbs for miles
5. **Ignoring rotation** - Food expires, batteries die
6. **Buying gear before learning skills** - Skills beat gear every time
7. **Skipping redundancy** - Two is one, one is none
