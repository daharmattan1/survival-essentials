## Image Resources

This repository documents sources for public domain images but doesn't include massive collections.

**Current Status**:
- ✅ **Plant identification sources** documented (6 major public domain sources)
- ✅ **Meat/fish processing sources** documented (FM 21-76, FAO, Archive.org)
- 🔄 **Future**: Curated 10-15 critical images stored in repo (~1-2MB)

**Recommended approach**:
- Download FM 21-76 from Archive.org (free, public domain)
