# Shelter - Emergency Shelter, Insulation, Location

**Priority**: Shelter comes before water in harsh conditions. Hypothermia kills in hours.

**Rule of 3s Reminder**: You can survive 3 hours without shelter in harsh conditions. In cold, wet, or windy weather, shelter is your #1 priority after addressing immediate injuries.

## Core Shelter Principles

### The Three Critical Functions

1. **Insulation from Ground** - Most heat loss occurs through conduction to cold ground
   - ALWAYS create a barrier between you and the ground
   - Use leaves, pine needles, clothing, backpack, anything
   - Minimum 6" of compressed material (12" loose)

2. **Wind Protection** - Wind chill accelerates hypothermia
   - Even light breeze dramatically increases heat loss
   - Shelter must block wind from all sides you'll be exposed to
   - Small, enclosed spaces retain heat better than large ones

3. **Waterproofing** - Staying dry = staying alive
   - Wet clothing loses 90% of insulating value
   - Waterproof roof is critical in rain/snow
   - Angle shelters for drainage, avoid low spots

### Size Matters

**Smaller = Warmer**
- Build shelter just big enough to fit your body
- Excess space requires excess heat to warm
- You want barely enough room to lie down/sit
- "Coffin-sized" is ideal for solo survival shelter

## Location Selection (Critical First Step)

**BEFORE building anything, spend 15 minutes finding the right spot:**

### Good Location Indicators ✅
- **Elevated but protected** - High enough to avoid flooding, low enough to avoid wind
- **Near resources** - Water source within 5-10 min walk (not right next to - insects/animals)
- **Dry ground** - Check for drainage patterns, avoid depressions
- **Natural windbreak** - Behind rocks, in tree clusters, on leeward side of ridges
- **Building materials nearby** - Branches, leaves, moss, debris
- **Visible to rescuers** - If rescue is likely, don't hide completely
- **Solid ground** - Avoid loose soil, rocks, or roots

### Location Red Flags ❌
- **Dead trees nearby** - "Widow-makers" fall in wind
- **Low-lying areas** - Flash flood risk, cold air sinks here
- **Right next to water** - Flooding, insects, animal traffic
- **Avalanche/rockfall zones** - Check upslope for hazards
- **Insect nests** - Check trees, ground, logs for bees/wasps/ants
- **Animal trails** - You don't want nighttime visitors
- **Completely exposed ridgelines** - Wind will destroy you
- **Under single large tree** - Lightning risk in storms

**Time Investment**: 15 minutes scouting location saves hours of misery in bad spot.

## Wilderness Shelter Types

### 1. Debris Hut (Best All-Around Wilderness Shelter)

**When to use**: Cold/wet conditions, overnight+ stays, you have time (2-4 hours)

**Why it's best**: Excellent insulation, windproof, waterproof if built correctly, retains body heat

**Difficulty**: Moderate | **Time**: 2-4 hours | **Capacity**: 1 person

#### Materials Needed
- Ridge pole: 1 strong branch, 7-10 ft long, diameter of your wrist
- Ribs: 6-10 branches, 5-7 ft long
- Debris: LOTS - leaves, pine needles, grass, bark (garbage bag sized pile = not enough)
- Support: 2 forked sticks or a tree/rock to anchor ridge pole

#### Step-by-Step Construction

1. **Create the frame**
   - Find or create a forked stick (shoulder height) to support ridge pole
   - Lean ridge pole against support at 30-45° angle
   - Other end should rest on ground, creating a low tunnel

2. **Add ribs**
   - Lean branches on both sides of ridge pole at 45° angle
   - Space them 12-18" apart
   - Should create a triangular cross-section
   - Stop ribs 2-3 ft from the top end (creates entrance)

3. **Layer small sticks crosswise**
   - Add smaller branches perpendicular to ribs
   - Creates lattice to hold debris
   - Gaps should be smaller than your debris material

4. **Add debris - THE CRITICAL STEP**
   - Start at bottom, work upward (like roofing shingles)
   - Minimum 2-3 feet thick (seriously - pile it on)
   - Pack debris loosely - air pockets insulate
   - Cover entire structure except small entrance
   - Test: Should look like a huge leaf pile, not a neat structure

5. **Create entrance plug**
   - Make a debris-stuffed bag or pile
   - Must block entrance once you're inside
   - Critical for heat retention

6. **Ground insulation**
   - Fill interior floor with 12"+ of leaves/pine needles
   - Compress to 6" by lying on it
   - This is your mattress - don't skip it

#### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Not enough debris (if you can see the frame, you need more)
- ❌ Debris too thin (minimum 2 feet, 3 feet better)
- ❌ No ground insulation (you'll freeze from below)
- ❌ Entrance too large (can't retain heat)
- ❌ Building too big (wastes time, harder to heat)

#### Testing Your Debris Hut
- Crawl inside - it should be dark (light = cold air gaps)
- Should feel snug, almost claustrophobic
- After 10 minutes inside, it should feel noticeably warmer
- In true emergency, your breath should fog inside

### 2. Lean-To (Quick Emergency Shelter)

**When to use**: Need shelter fast (1-2 hours), moderate conditions, may have tarp/poncho

**Why use it**: Faster than debris hut, good with tarp, easier to build fire in front

**Drawbacks**: Less insulation, open on one side, harder to heat

**Difficulty**: Easy | **Time**: 1-2 hours | **Capacity**: 1-2 people

#### Materials Needed
- Ridge pole: 1 strong branch, 8-12 ft long
- Support: 2 trees (ideal) or forked sticks
- Ribs: 8-12 branches, 6-8 ft long
- Covering: Tarp, poncho, or LOTS of debris/bark

#### Step-by-Step Construction

1. **Position ridge pole**
   - Secure horizontally between two trees (chest-shoulder height)
   - Or use forked sticks driven into ground
   - Test for stability - should hold your weight

2. **Add angled ribs**
   - Lean branches from ground to ridge pole at 45-60° angle
   - Space 12-18" apart
   - Longer ribs = more floor space but harder to cover

3. **Cover the structure**
   - **With tarp**: Drape over ribs, stake bottom edge, angle for rain runoff
   - **Without tarp**: Layer debris 2+ feet thick, bottom-to-top
   - **Bark option**: Layer large bark sheets like shingles (very effective)

4. **Create wind walls**
   - Build debris walls on sides perpendicular to opening
   - Critical for warmth - open side faces fire, walls block wind

5. **Ground insulation**
   - Same as debris hut - 12" loose material, compresses to 6"

6. **Optional reflector fire**
   - Build fire 4-6 ft from opening
   - Stack rocks/logs behind fire to reflect heat into shelter
   - NEVER sleep with fire unattended

#### Lean-To + Fire Configuration
```
[Rock reflector]
      🔥 Fire
         \  (heat reflection)
          \
    [Lean-to shelter]
       /you/
    [ground insulation]
```

### 3. A-Frame Shelter (Intermediate Option)

**When to use**: Longer-term stay (several days), want more space, have tarp/paracord

**Why use it**: More headroom than debris hut, easier to organize gear, can accommodate 2 people

**Difficulty**: Moderate | **Time**: 2-3 hours | **Capacity**: 1-2 people

#### Materials Needed
- Ridge pole: 1 branch, 10-12 ft long, thick as your arm
- A-frame supports: 4 strong branches, 5-6 ft long
- Side ribs: 12-16 branches, 6-8 ft long
- Covering: Tarp or extensive debris
- Cordage: Paracord or natural cordage (if available)

#### Step-by-Step Construction

1. **Create A-frame supports**
   - Lash or prop 2 pairs of branches into "A" shapes
   - Position 6-8 ft apart
   - Height: 3-4 ft at peak

2. **Install ridge pole**
   - Rest ridge pole in the V of both A-frames
   - Secure with lashings if you have cordage
   - Should be very stable

3. **Add ribs on both sides**
   - Lean branches from ground to ridge pole on both sides
   - Creates triangular cross-section
   - Space 12-18" apart

4. **Cover completely**
   - If using tarp: Drape over ridge, stake corners, create rain runoff
   - If using debris: 2-3 ft thick layers on all sides
   - Leave small entrance at one end

5. **Seal ends**
   - Front end: Small entrance, create plug
   - Back end: Fully sealed with debris or tarp

6. **Interior setup**
   - Ground insulation: 12" of debris
   - Gear storage area at back
   - Sleeping area near entrance (easier to regulate ventilation)

### 4. Snow Shelters (Winter Survival)

**CRITICAL**: Snow shelters require knowledge and practice. Mistakes can be fatal (burial, suffocation, CO2 buildup). Practice in safe conditions first.

#### Snow Cave (Best Winter Shelter)

**When to use**: Deep snow (5+ ft), sub-freezing temps, overnight+ stay

**Difficulty**: Moderate-Hard | **Time**: 3-5 hours | **Capacity**: 1-2 people

**Step-by-Step Construction**

1. **Find appropriate snowbank**
   - Minimum 5-6 ft deep, consolidated snow (not powder)
   - Test with stick to confirm depth
   - Avoid avalanche terrain

2. **Dig entrance tunnel**
   - Start on downwind side
   - Dig horizontal tunnel 3-4 ft into bank
   - Entrance should be lower than sleeping platform (cold air sinks)

3. **Excavate sleeping chamber**
   - From end of tunnel, dig upward and outward
   - Create dome-shaped ceiling (prevents drips, stronger)
   - Sleeping platform should be 1-2 ft higher than entrance

4. **Critical safety features**
   - **Ventilation hole**: Punch ski pole/stick through ceiling (fist-sized hole)
   - Check hole every few hours - can get blocked by snow
   - **Smooth ceiling**: Rough = drips on you
   - **Mark entrance**: From outside with branch/gear

5. **Interior setup**
   - Pack sleeping platform smooth and flat
   - Insulation beneath you (pad, branches, anything)
   - Small shelf carved in wall for candle/light

**Safety warnings**:
- ⚠️ ALWAYS maintain ventilation hole
- ⚠️ Never seal entrance completely
- ⚠️ Tell someone your location
- ⚠️ Keep digging tool inside with you
- ⚠️ Interior temp should stay around 32°F (feels warm compared to outside)

#### Quinzhee (Snow Pile Shelter - No Snowbank Needed)

**When to use**: Open terrain, no snowbanks, deep powder snow

**Difficulty**: Hard (very labor-intensive) | **Time**: 4-6 hours | **Capacity**: 1-2 people

**Step-by-Step Construction**

1. **Pile snow**
   - Create mound 8-10 ft diameter, 6+ ft high
   - Pile loosely - don't pack yet
   - Let consolidate for 1-2 hours (critical - don't skip)

2. **Insert depth markers**
   - Push 12" sticks into pile from outside, all around
   - These tell you when to stop digging (prevents breakthrough)

3. **Dig it out**
   - After snow consolidates, dig entrance tunnel
   - Hollow out interior until you hit stick ends
   - Create dome ceiling

4. **Same safety features as snow cave**

**Energy warning**: Quinzhee building is exhausting. Only attempt if you have calories to burn.

## Urban/Home Shelter (Power Outages, Winter Storms)

**Context**: Power out, no heat, temperatures dropping. Most likely survival scenario for many people.

### The "Room Within a Room" Method

**Concept**: Heat one small space instead of entire house

1. **Choose smallest room** - Bathroom, closet, interior bedroom (no windows ideal)

2. **Seal it off**
   - Hang blankets over doorway
   - Towels under door gap
   - Cover windows with blankets + cardboard (insulation + block drafts)
   - Tape gaps if you have it

3. **Create the shelter layer**
   - Build tent inside the room using blankets/sheets over furniture
   - Creates second insulation layer
   - Sleep inside this tent

4. **Ground insulation**
   - Layer blankets, sleeping bags, coats on floor
   - Mattress is good, but ground padding matters more
   - Cardboard, yoga mats, anything to stop conduction

5. **Body heat management**
   - Multiple people = more warmth (all sleep in same space)
   - Dress in layers but not so much you sweat
   - Swap wet clothes for dry immediately

6. **Heat sources (BE CAREFUL)**
   - ✅ Body heat (safest)
   - ✅ Hot water bottles (boil water on camp stove, fill bottles)
   - ⚠️ Candles (1-2 tea candles add warmth, MONITOR ALWAYS)
   - ❌ Never use propane heater indoors without ventilation (CO poisoning)
   - ❌ Never use charcoal indoors (CO death sentence)
   - ❌ Never leave candles unattended

### Vehicle Shelter (Stranded in Car)

**If stuck in car during winter storm:**

1. **Stay with vehicle** - More visible than you are on foot
2. **Run engine sparingly** - 10 min/hour max, keep exhaust clear of snow
3. **Crack window** - Carbon monoxide prevention
4. **Create insulation** - Floor mats, cardboard from trunk, seats as barriers
5. **Move around** - Prevents frostbite, generates heat
6. **Stay visible** - Tie bright cloth to antenna, dome light on at night

## Emergency Shelter Materials Guide

### Natural Materials (Wilderness)

**Insulation (in order of effectiveness)**
1. **Dead leaves** - Excellent, usually abundant
2. **Pine needles** - Very good, doesn't compress as much
3. **Grass/hay** - Good when dry, compresses easily
4. **Bark** - Excellent for waterproofing layers
5. **Moss** - Good insulation, can be damp
6. **Cattail fluff** - Excellent but labor-intensive to gather

**Structural**
1. **Dead standing branches** - Ideal (dry, strong)
2. **Fallen branches** - Check for rot
3. **Bamboo** - Excellent if available
4. **Saplings** - Use sparingly (live trees = resource depletion)

### Modern Materials (Urban/Vehicle)

**Insulation**
- Newspaper (crumpled - 2" layer = decent insulation)
- Cardboard (corrugated is best)
- Styrofoam/packing materials
- Clothing (even if not wearing it)
- Car seat foam

**Barriers**
- Trash bags (waterproof layer)
- Tarp (if you have it)
- Emergency blanket (more for wind than warmth)
- Plastic sheeting

## Shelter Building Tips & Tricks

### Time Management
- Don't wait until dark to start - you'll fail
- Start building 2-3 hours before dark
- Better to have "good enough" shelter in daylight than perfect shelter built in dark

### Energy Conservation
- Build smallest shelter that works
- Use natural features (rock overhangs, fallen trees, downed logs)
- Don't reinvent the wheel - natural shelter + improvements often best

### Testing Your Shelter
- Lie down in it before committing
- Check for drafts, water drainage, overhead hazards
- Better to rebuild now than freeze tonight

### The "Good Enough" Principle
- Perfect shelter takes 6 hours
- Good enough shelter takes 2 hours
- 2 hours of adequate shelter + 4 hours gathering firewood/water = better survival
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of warm and alive

## Shelter Priority Checklist

Before sleeping, verify:
- [ ] Ground insulation in place (can't feel cold through material)
- [ ] No drafts at entrance/sides
- [ ] Overhead cover is waterproof (or won't matter if it rains)
- [ ] No widow-makers overhead
- [ ] Entrance can be sealed
- [ ] You can exit quickly if needed (animals, flooding, fire)
- [ ] Visible to rescuers if rescue is likely

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Location matters more than construction** - 15 min scouting > 3 hours in bad spot
2. **Ground insulation is non-negotiable** - More heat loss below than above
3. **Smaller = warmer** - Build just big enough
4. **Layer debris thicker than you think** - If you can see frame, add more
5. **Test before dark** - Lie down, check for drafts and cold spots

**Remember**: The best shelter is the one that keeps you alive tonight. Don't overthink it - build it, test it, improve it.
