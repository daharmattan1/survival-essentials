# Shelter - Emergency Shelter, Insulation, Location

**Priority**: Shelter comes before water in harsh conditions. Hypothermia kills in hours.

## Core Concepts (To be expanded)

- Insulation from ground (most heat loss)
- Wind protection (wind chill kills)
- Waterproofing (staying dry = staying warm)
- Location selection (avoid hazards)

**Status**: Placeholder - to be completed with:
- Natural shelter types (debris hut, lean-to, snow cave)
- Urban shelter (home insulation during outages)
- Emergency shelter materials
- Location selection criteria

**Temporary Reference**: See [10_key_resources.md](10_key_resources.md) for external shelter building guides.
