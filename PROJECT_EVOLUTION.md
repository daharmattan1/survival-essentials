## NEW: Practical Survival Essentials Directory

**Location**: [../survival-essentials/](../survival-essentials/)

We've created a focused "just in case" survival knowledge base that lives in this repo:

### What It Contains

1. **[Core Principles](../survival-essentials/01_core_principles.md)** - Rule of 3s, STOP principle, priorities
2. **[Water](../survival-essentials/02_water.md)** - Procurement, purification, storage (complete)
3. **[Fire](../survival-essentials/03_fire.md)** - Starting methods, structures, maintenance (complete)
4. **[Shelter](../survival-essentials/04_shelter.md)** - Placeholder (to be completed)
5. **[Food](../survival-essentials/05_food.md)** - Placeholder (to be completed)
6. **[First Aid](../survival-essentials/06_first_aid.md)** - Placeholder (to be completed)
7. **[Navigation](../survival-essentials/07_navigation.md)** - Placeholder (to be completed)
8. **[Communication](../survival-essentials/08_communication.md)** - Placeholder (to be completed)
9. **[Urban Survival](../survival-essentials/09_urban_survival.md)** - Power outages, bugging in (complete)
10. **[Key Resources](../survival-essentials/10_key_resources.md)** - Minimal external references (complete)

### Philosophy

**80/20 Rule**: The 20% of survival knowledge that covers 80% of realistic scenarios.

**Realistic Scenarios**:
- Multi-day power outage (most likely)
- Stranded during travel
- Natural disaster evacuation
- Supply chain disruption
- Medical emergency without EMS
- Communication blackout

**What This IS**:
- Markdown-based core knowledge (offline-readable)
- Practical takeaways for realistic scenarios
- Quick reference for emergencies
- <5MB storage in this repo

**What This IS NOT**:
- Comprehensive survival encyclopedia
- PDF collection repository (50-100GB)
- Prepper manifesto
- Military field manual library

## Recommendation

**Start with**: [survival-essentials/](../survival-essentials/) - Core knowledge, realistic scenarios, minimal storage

**Expand to**: Original guide repositories - Only if you need comprehensive external resources

**Priority**: Practice 5 core skills (water, fire, shelter, first aid, navigation) before collecting more knowledge.
