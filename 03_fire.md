# Fire - Starting, Maintenance, Safety

**Fire provides**: Warmth, water purification, cooking, morale, signaling, predator deterrent.

## Fire Starting Methods (Two-is-One Principle)

### Method 1: Lighter (Primary)

**Pros**: Fast, reliable, works when wet (if quality lighter)
**Cons**: Limited fuel, can break
**Backup**: Always carry two lighters

### Method 2: Waterproof Matches

**Pros**: More strikes than lighter
**Cons**: Can get wet if not stored properly
**Tip**: Store in waterproof container with striker strip

### Method 3: Ferro Rod (Ferrocerium Rod)

**Pros**: Works wet, 10,000+ strikes, no fuel needed
**Cons**: Requires practice, needs dry tinder
**Technique**: Strike rod with back of knife blade, shower sparks onto tinder

### Method 4: Magnifying Glass (Solar)

**Pros**: Infinite uses in sunlight
**Cons**: Only works in direct sun, slow
**Technique**: Focus beam to smallest point on tinder until smoke appears

### Method 5: Friction (Bow Drill, Hand Drill)

**Pros**: No tools needed, works anywhere with wood
**Cons**: Extremely difficult, energy-intensive, requires practice
**Reality Check**: This is a last resort, not a primary method

## Fire Building Structure

### The Three Components

1. **Tinder**: Catches spark, burns quickly (1-2 minutes)
2. **Kindling**: Sustains flame, builds heat (5-10 minutes)
3. **Fuel**: Main burn, provides long-lasting fire (hours)

### Tinder Examples

**Natural**:
- Dry grass, pine needles
- Birch bark (peels easily)
- Dead leaves (crumbled fine)
- Cattail fluff
- Char cloth (pre-made)

**Man-made**:
- Dryer lint (extremely effective)
- Cotton balls + petroleum jelly (waterproof)
- Paper, cardboard
- Steel wool + 9V battery (emergency)

### Kindling Examples

- Small twigs (pencil thickness)
- Dry bark strips
- Split wood pieces (finger thickness)
- Pine cones

### Fuel Examples

- Arm-thickness dry branches
- Split logs
- Hardwood (oak, maple - burns longer)
- Softwood (pine, fir - burns hotter, faster)

## Fire Lay Structures

### Teepee (Best for Quick Start)

```
       /\
      /  \
     /tinder\
    /   |    \
```

**Setup**:
1. Place tinder bundle in center
2. Lean kindling against each other in cone shape
3. Leave opening for lighting
4. Add progressively larger pieces

**Pros**: Easy to light, good airflow
**Cons**: Collapses as it burns (have fuel ready)

### Log Cabin (Best for Sustained Heat)

```
 ≡≡≡≡≡
≡tinder≡
 ≡≡≡≡≡
```

**Setup**:
1. Place two logs parallel
2. Place two perpendicular on top
3. Continue stacking, getting smaller toward top
4. Fill center with tinder and kindling

**Pros**: Burns evenly, stable, good for cooking
**Cons**: Uses more wood

### Lean-To (Best in Wind)

```
  ===WIND===→
       |\\\\
    tinder\\\\
       |\\\\
```

**Setup**:
1. Place large log as windbreak
2. Lean kindling against log
3. Put tinder under kindling shelter
4. Light from downwind side

**Pros**: Protects from wind
**Cons**: One-sided heat

## Fire Location

### Good Locations

- Flat, clear area
- Away from overhanging branches (10+ feet)
- Protected from wind (but not enclosed)
- Near water source (safety)
- On mineral soil or rock (not organic matter)

### Bad Locations

- Under trees (falling embers = forest fire)
- Near dry grass/brush
- In enclosed spaces (carbon monoxide)
- On peat/organic soil (underground fire)
- Too close to shelter (spark risk)

---

## Wet Weather Fire

### Finding Dry Wood

**Look for**:
- Standing dead wood (not ground wood)
- Under dense evergreen canopy
- Inside fallen logs (split to access dry core)
- Resinous wood (pine - burns even damp)

**Tip**: Dead branches that snap cleanly are dry; if they bend, they're wet.

### Processing Wet Wood

1. Split wood to expose dry interior
2. Feather sticks (shave curls while attached)
3. Use double tinder (more volume)
4. Create shelter over fire site

### Feather Stick Technique

- Take dry stick
- Shave thin curls along length (keep attached)
- Creates more surface area for ignition
- Works even with damp outer wood

## Fire Maintenance

### Keeping Fire Alive Overnight

**Method 1: Long Log**
- Place large hardwood log in fire
- Burns slowly over 6-8 hours
- Easier to rekindle in morning

**Method 2: Banking**
- Cover fire with ash and soil
- Restricts oxygen = slow burn
- Uncover and add kindling in morning

### Conserving Fire

- Don't build fire larger than needed
- Use reflector (log or rocks) to direct heat
- Build close to shelter for efficiency
- Keep dry wood stockpile nearby

## Safety

### Fire Safety Rules

1. **Clear 10-foot diameter** around fire
2. **Keep water/dirt nearby** for emergencies
3. **Never leave unattended** in wilderness
4. **Extinguish completely** before sleeping (if not maintaining)
5. **Avoid enclosed spaces** (carbon monoxide)

### Extinguishing Fire

**Proper Method**:
1. Let burn down to coals
2. Spread coals with stick
3. Pour water over coals
4. Stir with stick
5. Repeat until no steam/hissing
6. Touch ashes - should be cool

**Never**:
- Just cover with dirt (can smolder underground)
- Walk away while still hot

### Burns Treatment

**Minor Burns**:
- Cool with clean water (not ice)
- Cover with clean cloth
- Don't pop blisters

**Severe Burns**:
- Cool immediately
- Cover with clean, moist cloth
- Seek medical help (likely infection risk)

## Fire Starting in Extreme Conditions

### High Altitude/Cold

- Wood burns slower (less oxygen)
- Use more tinder and kindling
- Allow extra time for ignition
- Keep matches/lighter warm (body heat)

### Rain/Snow

- Build raised platform of green logs
- Create overhead shelter with tarp
- Use double the normal tinder
- Process wood to dry interior

### High Wind

- Dig fire pit below ground level
- Use natural windbreak (rocks, logs)
- Build lean-to structure
- Light from downwind side

---

## Alternative Heat Sources (When Fire Not Possible)

1. **Chemical heat packs** (air-activated)
2. **Candles** (tea lights last 4-6 hours)
3. **Body heat** (huddle, insulation)
4. **Exercise** (generates warmth, costs calories)

---

## Signaling With Fire

### Smoke Signals

**Daytime**:
- Add green vegetation to create thick white smoke
- Create three fires in triangle (international distress)
- Build on high ground for visibility

**Nighttime**:
- Bright flame is visible for miles
- Three fires in triangle pattern
- Add dry wood for intense flame

---

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Before Lighting**:
- [ ] Location cleared and safe
- [ ] Tinder prepared and dry
- [ ] Kindling collected and nearby
- [ ] Fuel wood stockpiled
- [ ] Water/extinguishing method ready
- [ ] Wind direction noted

**Fire Progression**:
1. Ignite tinder
2. Add kindling gradually (don't smother)
3. Add fuel when kindling established
4. Maintain, don't over-feed

## Key Takeaways

1. **Carry two fire starting methods** (lighter + matches, or lighter + ferro rod)
2. **Tinder is critical** - collect/prepare before attempting fire
3. **Standing dead wood** is driest, even in rain
4. **Location matters** - clear area, away from hazards
5. **More people die from cold than hunger** - prioritize fire after shelter
