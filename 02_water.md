# Water - Procurement, Purification, Storage

**Critical**: You need ~1 gallon (4 liters) per person per day for drinking and basic hygiene.

## Finding Water Sources

### Natural Sources (Priority Order)

1. **Running streams/rivers** (best quality)
2. **Springs** (often cleaner than surface water)
3. **Lakes/ponds** (needs purification)
4. **Rainwater collection** (cleanest, if collected properly)
5. **Morning dew** (emergency only, labor-intensive)
6. **Snow/ice** (must melt, costs energy)

### Urban/Suburban Sources

1. **Water heater tank** (40-80 gallons stored)
2. **Toilet tank** (not bowl - 3-5 gallons, usually clean)
3. **Ice in freezer** (melts to drinking water)
4. **Canned goods liquid** (vegetables, fruits)
5. **Swimming pools** (purify before drinking)

## Purification Methods

### Method 1: Boiling (Most Reliable)

- **Rolling boil for 1 minute** (3 minutes above 6,500 ft elevation)
- Kills all pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites)
- Doesn't remove chemicals/heavy metals
- Let cool before drinking

### Method 2: Water Purification Tablets

- **Iodine or chlorine dioxide tablets**
- Follow package directions (usually 30-60 min wait)
- Effective against most pathogens
- Taste can be unpleasant (add vitamin C after to neutralize)

### Method 3: Filtration

- **Commercial filter** (LifeStraw, Sawyer, etc.)
- Removes bacteria and parasites
- Does NOT remove viruses (usually not issue in US/Canada wilderness)
- **DIY filter**: Layered sand, charcoal, gravel (removes particles, not pathogens)

### Method 4: UV Light (SteriPEN)

- **90 seconds of UV exposure**
- Kills bacteria, viruses, parasites
- Requires batteries/charge
- Water must be clear (pre-filter if murky)

### Method 5: Bleach (Emergency Only)

- **2 drops plain bleach per quart** (or 8 drops per gallon)
- Must be plain bleach (no scents/additives)
- Wait 30 minutes before drinking
- Emergency use, not long-term solution

## Collection Methods

### Rainwater Catchment

**Setup**:
- Clean tarp/plastic sheet angled to funnel water
- Secure corners to trees or stakes
- Create low point for collection bucket
- Cover bucket to prevent contamination

**Yield**: 1 inch of rain on 100 sq ft = ~60 gallons

### Dew Collection

**Method**:
- Tie absorbent cloth around ankles
- Walk through dewy grass at dawn
- Wring out into container
- Repeat until you have enough

**Yield**: Labor-intensive, ~1 cup per hour

### Transpiration Bag

**Setup**:
- Place clear plastic bag over leafy tree branch
- Seal end with cord/rubber band
- Weight corner to create collection point
- Wait 4-6 hours

**Yield**: ~1 cup per bag per day

### Solar Still (Last Resort)

**Setup**:
- Dig hole 3 ft wide, 2 ft deep
- Place container in center
- Cover with clear plastic, weighted edges
- Place small rock in center over container

**Yield**: ~1 quart per day (very low efficiency)

## Storage

### Containers

**Good Options**:
- Food-grade plastic bottles (water bottles, soda bottles)
- Glass jars with lids
- Stainless steel containers
- BPA-free plastic containers

**Avoid**:
- Milk jugs (degrade quickly)
- Non-food grade plastics
- Containers that held chemicals

### Storage Best Practices

1. **Clean containers thoroughly** before filling
2. **Label with date** purified/stored
3. **Store in cool, dark place** (light degrades plastic)
4. **Rotate every 6 months** (mark rotation schedule)
5. **Keep away from gasoline/chemicals** (plastics absorb odors)

### Long-term Storage Treatment

- Add 2 drops bleach per quart (prevents algae/bacteria growth)
- Or use commercial water preserver (extends to 5 years)
- Seal containers tightly

## Signs of Dehydration

### Mild (5% loss)
- Thirst
- Dry mouth
- Dark yellow urine
- Fatigue

### Moderate (10% loss)
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Rapid heartbeat
- Little to no urination

### Severe (15%+ loss)
- Confusion
- Extreme weakness
- Blue lips
- Medical emergency

**Action**: If you're thirsty, you're already dehydrated. Drink regularly, not just when thirsty.

## Water Testing (Without Kit)

**Visual Check**:
- Clear is better than cloudy
- No visible algae or organisms
- No oily sheen on surface
- No dead animals upstream

**Smell Test**:
- Should be odorless
- Avoid sulfur smell (possible contamination)
- Avoid chemical smell

**When in Doubt**: Assume contamination, purify anyway.

---

## Emergency Situations

### No Purification Method Available

**Priority Order**:
1. Boil if you have fire (safest)
2. Use clearest source available
3. Let water sit 30 min (sediment settles)
4. Filter through cloth (removes particles only)
5. Drink and deal with illness later (dehydration kills faster)

### Saltwater/Seawater

**Never drink directly** - accelerates dehydration.

**Desalination** (requires fire):
1. Boil saltwater in container
2. Capture steam with cloth/cup
3. Condensed water is fresh
4. Extremely energy-intensive

## Quick Reference Decision Tree

```
Do you have water source?
├─ NO → Search for water (see Finding Water Sources)
└─ YES → Is it contaminated/uncertain?
    ├─ NO → Drink (but monitor for changes)
    └─ YES → Can you boil?
        ├─ YES → Boil for 1 minute
        └─ NO → Use tablets/filter/UV/bleach (in that order)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Purify everything** except sealed commercial bottles
2. **Boiling is gold standard** - works on everything
3. **Ration sweat, not water** - drink when you have it
4. **Water heater = hidden reservoir** in urban scenarios
5. **Collection takes time** - start early, collect continuously
