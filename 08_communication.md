**Context**: Cell towers down, internet out. Alternative communication methods.

## Core Concepts (To be expanded)

- Visual signals (mirror, smoke, ground markers)
- Audio signals (whistle, three-shot pattern)
- Radio basics (ham, CB, FRS/GMRS)
- Mesh networks (off-grid communication)
- Pre-arranged plans with family

**Status**: Placeholder - to be completed with:
- International distress signals (SOS, three fires, etc.)
- Signal mirror use
- Whistle signals
- Ham radio primer (licensing, equipment)
- CB radio basics (no license needed)
- FRS/GMRS walkie-talkies
- Mesh network options (goTenna, Beartooth)
- Family communication plans
- Code words for "safe" vs "danger"
