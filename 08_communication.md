# Communication - Signals, Ham Radio, Mesh Networks

**Context**: Cell towers down, internet out, you need help or need to reach family. Alternative communication methods matter.

**Two Scenarios:**
1. **Emergency signaling**: You need rescue (visual/audio signals for search teams)
2. **Grid-down communication**: Infrastructure down, need to reach family/community (radios, mesh networks)

---

## Emergency Signaling (For Rescue)

### Universal Distress Signal: Rule of Three

**Anything in threes = distress**
- 3 whistle blasts
- 3 gunshots
- 3 fires in triangle
- 3 mirror flashes
- 3 of anything

**Why three**: Universal pattern, distinguishable from natural occurrences (which rarely come in threes)

**Response**: If you hear 3 signals, respond with 2 signals (acknowledges distress, shows help is coming)

---

### 1. Signal Mirror (Most Effective Daytime Visual Signal)

**Effectiveness**: Visible 10-20+ miles in clear conditions. Can catch pilot's attention from aircraft.

**What you need**: Mirror, shiny metal, CD, phone screen (anything reflective)

**How to use:**

1. **Create aiming hole** (if improvising)
   - Punch small hole in center of material (or use commercial signal mirror with aiming hole)
   - Or hold up two fingers in V-shape as sight

2. **Catch sunlight**
   - Angle mirror toward sun
   - Reflect light onto hand or nearby surface (see the bright spot)

3. **Aim at target**
   - Hold mirror close to eye
   - Look through hole (or between fingers) at target (aircraft, distant person)
   - Move mirror until reflected light spot crosses the target

4. **Flash signal**
   - Sweep light across target repeatedly
   - If no specific target, flash at horizon where aircraft might appear
   - Use SOS pattern if you know it (3 short, 3 long, 3 short)

**Pro tips:**
- Flash periodically even if you don't see aircraft (they might see you first)
- Works on cloudy days too (any sunlight is enough)
- Even reflected moonlight can work (faint but visible)
- Don't stare directly at bright reflection (eye damage)

**Commercial vs improvised:**
- **Commercial signal mirror**: Has aiming hole, retroreflector (more effective)
- **Improvised** (CD, phone, foil): Works but less precise
- **Best field expedient**: Mylar emergency blanket (fold into square)

---

### 2. Whistle Signals (Audio Signaling)

**Why whistle > yelling:**
- Less energy
- Carries further
- Doesn't damage throat
- Works when you can't yell (injury, exhaustion)

**Range**: 1-2 miles in open terrain (vs ~0.5 mile for yelling)

**Signal patterns:**

**Standard distress** (Rule of Three):
- 3 sharp blasts
- Pause 1 minute
- Repeat

**If you hear whistle:**
- Respond with 2 blasts (acknowledges signal)
- Or yell "Where are you?"

**Best practices:**
- Keep whistle on necklace/zipper pull (accessible if injured)
- Blow LOUD - short, sharp blasts (not long breathy ones)
- Signal every 5-10 minutes (conserve energy, give searchers time to respond)
- Stop and listen between signals (might hear response)

**Whistle types:**
- **Pealess** (no ball inside): Best - works when wet, in freezing temps
- **Pea whistle** (ball inside): Louder when dry, but freezes/clogs

---

### 3. Smoke Signals

**When to use**: Daytime, when you hear aircraft or see distant people

**How to create smoke:**

**Black smoke** (most visible against sky):
- Add wet/green vegetation to fire
- Add rubber, plastic (if desperate - toxic fumes, avoid breathing)
- Tire rubber creates thick black smoke

**White smoke** (visible against dark terrain/trees):
- Add lots of green leaves/grass to fire
- Damp pine boughs work well

**Technique:**
1. Have fire established and burning hot
2. When you hear/see aircraft, add smoke material
3. Create pulses (3 distinct smoke columns if possible)
4. Keep adding material - thick smoke is more visible than thin

**Limitations:**
- Wind disperses smoke quickly
- Forest canopy can obscure
- Only works in daylight
- Can start forest fire if not careful

---

### 4. Ground-to-Air Signals

**When to use**: Open area, hoping for aerial search

**International ground-to-air signals (make LARGE - minimum 10 ft):**

**Most critical signals:**
- **X** = Need medical assistance
- **I** = Need medical supplies
- **F** = Need food and water
- **→** = Moving in this direction
- **LL** = All well
- **V** = Need assistance (general)

**How to create:**
- Rocks, logs arranged in patterns
- Cleared areas (scrape soil to show contrast)
- Bright fabric, tarps weighted down
- Shadows (dig trenches - shadows show pattern)

**Best practices:**
- Make LARGE (10 ft minimum, 20+ ft better)
- Create contrast (dark on light ground or vice versa)
- Use straight lines (distinguishable from nature)
- Create in open area (meadow, beach, clearing)

**SOS on ground:**
- Spell "SOS" in giant letters (20+ ft per letter)
- Create 3 fires in triangle (100+ ft apart)
- 3 rock piles in line

---

### 5. Fire Signals

**Three fires in triangle** = universal distress

**Setup:**
- Space 100+ ft apart
- Equilateral triangle pattern
- Keep fires small and manageable
- Have material ready to create smoke when needed

**When to light:**
- Dusk/night (visible for miles)
- When you hear aircraft
- Continuous if rescue is imminent

**Safety:**
- Clear area around each fire
- Never leave unattended
- Have water/dirt nearby to extinguish
- Don't start fires in dry/windy conditions (forest fire risk)

## Grid-Down Communication (Reaching Family/Community)

### 6. Family Communication Plan (DO THIS NOW)

**Before emergency, establish:**

1. **Rally points**
   - Primary: Home
   - Secondary: Relative's house, specific landmark
   - Out-of-area contact (if local phones down, long-distance might work)

2. **Communication schedule**
   - Specific times to attempt contact (e.g., noon and 6 PM daily)
   - Specific radio frequency/channel if using radios
   - Check-in location (physical place to leave messages)

3. **Code words**
   - "Safe" code word (indicates you're okay and not under duress)
   - "Danger" code word (indicates threat, don't come)
   - Use in phone calls, radio, written messages

4. **Communication hierarchy**
   - Try cell phone first
   - Then radio (if you have)
   - Then physical message at rally point
   - Then neighbor network

**Example plan:**
> "If separated during emergency:
> - Try cell phone every hour
> - Listen on FRS Channel 12 at noon and 6 PM daily
> - Rally at Grandma's house if can't reach by phone within 24 hours
> - Safe word: 'pineapple' - Danger word: 'coconut'
> - Out-of-area contact: Uncle Jim in Ohio (555-1234)"

### 7. FRS/GMRS Walkie-Talkies (Easiest Radio Option)

**FRS** (Family Radio Service):
- No license needed
- 22 channels
- 0.5-2 watt power
- Range: 0.5-2 miles (realistic in terrain), 5+ miles (ideal conditions)
- Cost: $20-50 per pair

**GMRS** (General Mobile Radio Service):
- License needed ($70, covers whole family, 10 years)
- Same 22 channels as FRS
- Higher power allowed (5-50 watts)
- Range: 5-20 miles (realistic with good radio)
- Can use repeaters (extends range significantly)

**How to use:**

1. **Pre-arrange channel/privacy code**
   - Choose channel (1-22)
   - Choose privacy code (1-121) - reduces interference
   - Write it down, share with family

2. **Basic operation**
   - Turn on, select channel
   - Press PTT (push-to-talk) button to transmit
   - Release to listen
   - Keep messages short

3. **Radio etiquette**
   - Listen before transmitting (don't interrupt)
   - Say call sign or name
   - Wait for response before continuing
   - Use "over" when finished, "out" when conversation done

**Best practices:**
- Pre-arrange check-in times (noon, 6 PM, etc.)
- Keep charged (many use AA batteries - have spares)
- Higher elevation = better range
- Obstacles (buildings, hills) reduce range significantly

---

### 8. CB Radio (No License, Medium Range)

**CB** (Citizens Band):
- No license needed
- 40 channels
- 4 watt limit
- Range: 3-10 miles mobile, 10-20 miles base station
- Popular with truckers (can request help)

**Advantages:**
- No license
- Widely used by truckers/RVers (built-in network)
- Can be mobile (car install) or base station (home)
- Channel 9 = emergency channel

**Disadvantages:**
- Lower range than ham
- More crowded/noisy channels
- Limited to voice (no data)

**Emergency use:**
- Channel 9 = emergency/traveler assistance
- Channel 19 = truckers (can request help)
- Local channels vary (research your area)

---

### 9. Ham Radio (Best Range, License Required)

**Amateur Radio** (Ham):
- License required (Technician = easiest, $35 exam fee)

### 10. Mesh Networks (Modern Off-Grid Option)

**What they are**: Device-to-device networks that don't need cell towers/internet

**Options:**

**goTenna Mesh** ($99-179 per device):
- Range: 1-4 miles (realistic), up to 10+ miles (ideal)
- Pairs with smartphone via Bluetooth
- Send text messages, GPS location
- Devices relay messages (mesh network grows with more users)
- No subscription fees
- Use: Hiking, disasters, grid-down

**Meshtastic** (DIY, $30-50 per device):
- Open-source mesh network
- Build your own with cheap hardware (ESP32 boards)
- Range: Similar to goTenna
- More technical to set up
- Active community
- No subscription fees

**How mesh works:**
- Your message hops from device to device
- More devices = stronger network
- Works without towers/internet
- Encrypted end-to-end

**Limitations:**
- Need multiple users in range
- Text only (no voice)
- Limited range vs. ham radio
- Requires charged batteries

---

### 11. Satellite Messengers (Most Reliable, Subscription Required)

**Garmin inReach** ($300-450 device + $12-65/mo subscription):
- Two-way text messaging via satellite
- Global coverage (works anywhere)
- SOS button (connects to rescue coordination)
- Can send GPS location
- No cell/radio infrastructure needed

**SPOT** ($150-200 device + $12-25/mo subscription):
- One-way messaging (pre-set messages)
- SOS button
- GPS tracking
- Cheaper than inReach but less capable

**When to use:**
- Remote backcountry (no cell coverage)
- Ocean/aviation
- Grid-down backup
- Peace of mind

---

### 12. Communication During Power Outage

**If cell towers still up but your power is out:**

1. **Charge phones in car** (12V USB adapter)
2. **Use battery banks** (keep charged)
3. **Text instead of call** (uses less battery, more likely to get through)
4. **Enable low power mode**
5. **Turn off wifi/Bluetooth** (save battery)

**If cell towers down:**
1. **FRS/GMRS radios** (pre-arranged channels)
2. **CB radio** (channel 9 for emergencies)
3. **Ham radio** (if licensed)
4. **Physical messages** at rally points
5. **Neighbor network** (pre-arrange check-ins)

---

## Communication Hierarchy (Order to Try)

**In emergency, try in this order:**

1. **Cell phone** - Call 911 or text (texts often work when calls don't)
2. **Landline** - If available (often works when cell doesn't)
3. **Signal mirror/whistle** - If rescue likely
4. **FRS/GMRS radio** - If family has radios on pre-arranged channel
5. **CB Radio** - Channel 9 (emergency) or 19 (truckers)
6. **Ham radio** - Local repeater or HF if licensed
7. **Satellite messenger** - If you have one
8. **Physical rally point** - Go to pre-arranged location

---

## Signal Effectiveness by Scenario

**Lost in wilderness (need rescue):**
1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Signal mirror (daytime, aircraft)
2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Whistle (ground search teams)
3. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Smoke signals (daytime, aircraft)
4. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Three fires (nighttime, aircraft)
5. ⭐⭐⭐ Ground signals (aerial search)

**Urban disaster (need to reach family):**
1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Cell phone (if towers up)
2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ FRS/GMRS (if family has radios)
3. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Physical rally point
4. ⭐⭐⭐ CB Radio (community network)
5. ⭐⭐⭐ Ham Radio (if licensed)

**Grid-down long-term:**
1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Ham Radio (long-range, community)
2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ CB Radio (local, no license)
3. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ FRS/GMRS (family/neighbors)
4. ⭐⭐⭐ Mesh networks (if community has devices)
5. ⭐⭐ Satellite messenger (if subscription active)

## Code Words & Communication Security

**Create code words for:**

1. **Safety status**
   - "Safe" word - indicates you're okay, not under duress
   - "Danger" word - indicates threat, don't approach
   - Use in any communication (phone, radio, written note)

2. **Location codes**
   - Assign code names to key locations
   - "Going to Pine" = heading to grandma's house
   - Prevents broadcasting exact locations on radio

3. **Supply status**
   - "We're fine" = have supplies
   - "Running low" = need resupply soon
   - "Empty" = critical need

**Example:**
> Safe word: "Pineapple"
> Danger word: "Coconut"
>
> Radio message: "We're at Pine, pineapple, running low on water."
> Translation: "We're at grandma's house, we're safe, need water soon."

**Why this matters:**
- Radios are NOT private (anyone can listen)
- Prevents broadcasting vulnerabilities
- Confirms identity (only family knows code words)
- Indicates duress without alerting threat

---

## Common Communication Mistakes

1. **No pre-arranged plan** → Family doesn't know where to go or what channel to check
2. **Assuming cell phones will work** → Towers go down in disasters
3. **Not learning radio before emergency** → Fumbling during crisis
4. **Broadcasting sensitive info** → "We have guns and food at 123 Main St" on open radio
5. **Forgetting batteries** → Dead radios are useless
6. **Not testing equipment** → Discovers radio doesn't work when needed
7. **No rally point** → Family separated with no way to reunite

---

## Key Principles

1. **Plan now, not during emergency** - Family communication plan is FREE and most important
2. **Rule of threes** = distress signal (3 whistles, fires, flashes)
3. **Signal mirror is king** for wilderness rescue (visible 10+ miles)
4. **Radios need pre-arrangement** - Agree on channel/times before emergency
5. **Multiple methods** - Don't rely on single communication type
6. **Test your equipment** - Dead batteries/broken radios are useless

**Remember**: The best communication device is the one you have with you and know how to use. Start with simple (whistle, FRS radios, family plan) before investing in complex systems.
