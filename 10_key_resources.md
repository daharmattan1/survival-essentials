## What NOT to Buy

### Overrated/Unnecessary

1. **Tactical gear obsession** - You're not special forces
2. **50+ types of survival knives** - One good knife > 10 cheap ones
3. **Freeze-dried food for years** - Start with 2 weeks, not 2 years
4. **Expensive bug-out bags** - Build your own, know every item
5. **Paracord bracelets** - Just carry 50 ft of paracord
6. **Zombie survival books** - Focus on realistic scenarios

### Focus Instead On

- Skills over gear
- Realistic scenarios over fantasies
- Redundancy over single expensive items
- Practice over collection
