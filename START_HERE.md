## What Makes This Special?

**Focused, Not Overwhelming**:
- 60KB of core knowledge (not 50GB of PDFs)
- Realistic scenarios (power outages, not zombie apocalypse)
- Urban/suburban focus (most people live in cities)

**Public Domain Everything**:
- All content links to public domain sources
- USDA databases (government work)
- Military manuals (FM 21-76)
- Biodiversity Heritage Library (150K+ images)
- No licensing restrictions

**Practical, Not Theoretical**:
- Water heater = 40-80 gallon hidden reservoir
- Fishing > foraging > hunting (calorie ROI)
- Boiling is gold standard (kills everything)
- Standing dead wood is driest (even in rain)

**Complete Yet Concise**:
- 6 complete guides (~50KB)
- 4 placeholders (can be completed later or left as-is)
- Public domain image resource documentation
- Project documentation for future maintainers

**My Recommendation**: Launch on GitHub this week with placeholders clearly marked. Get feedback. Iterate. Perfect is the enemy of done.

The 6 complete guides (~50KB) already provide massive value:
- Water (5 purification methods)
- Fire (5 starting methods)
- Food (foraging, fishing, hunting, growing - most comprehensive)
- Urban survival (power outages, bugging in)

**That's 80% of the value.** The placeholders are the remaining 20%.
