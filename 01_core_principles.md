# Core Survival Principles

## The Rule of 3s

You can survive:
- **3 minutes** without air (or in icy water)
- **3 hours** without shelter (in harsh conditions)
- **3 days** without water
- **3 weeks** without food

**Priority Order**: Air → Shelter → Water → Fire → Food

## STOP Principle (When Lost or Panicked)

- **S**it down
- **T**hink clearly
- **O**bserve your surroundings
- **P**lan your next action

Panic kills more than exposure. Slow down, breathe, think.

## Survival Priorities Framework

### Immediate (First Hour)
1. Address injuries/bleeding
2. Get out of immediate danger
3. Find/create shelter if weather is harsh
4. Signal for help if rescue is possible

### Short-term (First 24 Hours)
1. Secure shelter and warmth
2. Locate water source
3. Create signals for rescue
4. Inventory resources

### Medium-term (Days 2-7)
1. Establish reliable water source
2. Create fire for warmth/purification
3. Improve shelter
4. Forage/hunt if necessary

### Long-term (Week 2+)
1. Sustainable food procurement
2. Maintain morale and routine
3. Improve living conditions
4. Plan self-rescue if needed

## Mindset: The 10-80-10 Rule

In any survival situation:
- **10%** of people panic and freeze
- **80%** of people wait for instructions
- **10%** of people take action and lead

**Goal**: Be in the action-taking 10%. Leadership in crisis saves lives.

## Energy Conservation

Every action costs calories. Prioritize:
1. **High-return activities**: Water procurement, shelter building
2. **Avoid low-return activities**: Unnecessary movement, panic, excessive foraging

Conserve energy like it's your most valuable resource (because it is).

## The Two-is-One Principle

Critical items need backups:
- Two ways to start fire (matches + lighter)
- Two ways to purify water (boiling + tablets)
- Two ways to signal (mirror + whistle)

Redundancy prevents single points of failure.

## Observation Skills

**Weather Signs**:
- Red sky at night = good weather coming
- Red sky in morning = storms approaching
- Ring around moon = moisture, possible rain

**Navigation Aids**:
- Moss typically grows on north side of trees (Northern Hemisphere)
- Stars: Find North Star via Big Dipper
- Sun: Rises east, sets west, highest point south (Northern Hemisphere)

**Danger Indicators**:
- Animal trails lead to water (but also predators)
- Avoid low-lying areas in rain (flash flood risk)
- Dead trees = widow-makers in wind

## Decision-Making Under Stress

**Use the OODA Loop**:
1. **Observe**: What's happening?
2. **Orient**: What does this mean?
3. **Decide**: What should I do?
4. **Act**: Execute the decision

Then loop back to Observe. Keep cycling.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving without planning** - Stay put if rescue is coming
2. **Drinking unpurified water** - Dehydration > dysentery, but purify when possible
3. **Building fire before shelter** - Hypothermia kills faster than cold
4. **Panicking over food** - You can last weeks, focus on water/shelter first
5. **Ignoring injuries** - Small cuts become infections; treat immediately

## Key Takeaway

**Survival = Knowledge × Preparation × Mindset**

You can't control the situation, but you can control your response. Stay calm, prioritize correctly, and execute systematically.
