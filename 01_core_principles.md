# Core Survival Principles

## The Rule of 3s

You can survive:
- **3 minutes** without air (or in icy water)
- **3 hours** without shelter (in harsh conditions)
- **3 days** without water
- **3 weeks** without food

**Priority Order**: Air → Shelter → Water → Fire → Food

---

## STOP Principle (When Lost or Panicked)

- **S**it down
- **T**hink clearly
- **O**bserve your surroundings
- **P**lan your next action

Panic kills more than exposure. Slow down, breathe, think.

## Survival Priorities Framework

### Immediate (First Hour)
1. Address injuries/bleeding
2. Get out of immediate danger
3. Find/create shelter if weather is harsh
4. Signal for help if rescue is possible

### Short-term (First 24 Hours)
1. Secure shelter and warmth
2. Locate water source
3. Create signals for rescue
4. Inventory resources

### Medium-term (Days 2-7)
1. Establish reliable water source
2. Create fire for warmth/purification
3. Improve shelter
4. Forage/hunt if necessary

### Long-term (Week 2+)
1. Sustainable food procurement
2. Maintain morale and routine
3. Improve living conditions
4. Plan self-rescue if needed

## Mindset: The 10-80-10 Rule

In any survival situation:
- **10%** of people panic and freeze
- **80%** of people wait for instructions
- **10%** of people take action and lead

**Goal**: Be in the action-taking 10%. Leadership in crisis saves lives.

---

## Energy Conservation

Every action costs calories. Prioritize:
1. **High-return activities**: Water procurement, shelter building
2. **Avoid low-return activities**: Unnecessary movement, panic, excessive foraging

Conserve energy like it's your most valuable resource (because it is).

---

## The Two-is-One Principle

Critical items need backups:
- Two ways to start fire (matches + lighter)
- Two ways to purify water (boiling + tablets)
- Two ways to signal (mirror + whistle)

Redundancy prevents single points of failure.

---

## Observation Skills

**Weather Signs**:
- Red sky at night = good weather coming
- Red sky in morning = storms approaching
- Ring around moon = moisture, possible rain

**Navigation Aids**:
- Moss typically grows on north side of trees (Northern Hemisphere)
- Stars: Find North Star via Big Dipper
- Sun: Rises east, sets west, highest point south (Northern Hemisphere)

**Danger Indicators**:
- Animal trails lead to water (but also predators)
- Avoid low-lying areas in rain (flash flood risk)
- Dead trees = widow-makers in wind

---

## Decision-Making Under Stress

**Use the OODA Loop**:
1. **Observe**: What's happening?
2. **Orient**: What does this mean?
3. **Decide**: What should I do?
4. **Act**: Execute the decision

Then loop back to Observe. Keep cycling.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving without planning** - Stay put if rescue is coming
2. **Drinking unpurified water** - Dehydration > dysentery, but purify when possible
3. **Building fire before shelter** - Hypothermia kills faster than cold
4. **Panicking over food** - You can last weeks, focus on water/shelter first
5. **Ignoring injuries** - Small cuts become infections; treat immediately

---

## Survival Psychology (The Most Critical Skill)

**Reality**: More people die from panic, poor decisions, and giving up than from actual environmental threats.

### The Will to Live

**Survival situations are won or lost mentally first:**

- **Strong "why"**: People with clear reasons to survive (family, responsibilities) have higher survival rates
- **Positive self-talk**: "I can handle this" > "I'm going to die"
- **Small wins**: Completing small tasks builds confidence and momentum
- **Routine**: Maintaining daily structure prevents despair

**Ask yourself now**: "Why would I fight to survive?" Concrete answer = mental anchor in crisis.

---

### Managing Fear and Panic

**Fear is normal and useful** (heightens awareness, increases strength). **Panic is deadly** (causes poor decisions, wastes energy).

**When you feel panic rising:**

1. **Breathe** - Box breathing: 4 count in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold (repeat 5x)
2. **Ground yourself** - Name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you feel
3. **Take one action** - Any productive action breaks panic cycle (gather firewood, organize gear)
4. **Focus on what you CAN control** - Ignore what you can't

**Remember**: Panic is a thought pattern, not reality. You can change your thoughts.

---

### Loneliness and Isolation

**Extended survival scenarios = psychological challenge:**

- **Talk to yourself** - Narrate actions, make plans aloud (not crazy, it's helpful)
- **Create projects** - Improve shelter, organize camp (gives purpose)
- **Maintain hygiene** - Washing, grooming maintains dignity and mental health
- **Track time** - Mark days, keep schedule (prevents disorientation)
- **Find companionship** - Even a pet rock can help (seriously - people name objects for psychological comfort)

---

### The Survival Personality Traits

**Traits of successful survivors** (research-backed):

1. **Adaptability** - "Plan didn't work? Try something else" vs "Plan failed, I give up"
2. **Resourcefulness** - "What can I use?" vs "I don't have the right gear"
3. **Tenacity** - Refusing to quit, even when exhausted
4. **Realism** - Accurate assessment vs denial or catastrophizing
5. **Pattern recognition** - Learning from mistakes, adjusting approach

**You can develop these** - They're skills, not innate traits.

---

## Pre-Emergency Preparation (The Real Survival Work)

**Survival starts BEFORE the emergency:**

### Knowledge Preparation

1. **Take courses** - First aid/CPR, wilderness survival, local hazards
2. **Practice skills** - Build fire in rain, navigate without GPS, ID local plants
3. **Study your region** - Local hazards, water sources, escape routes
4. **Read and re-read** - Knowledge fades; review survival info quarterly

**One hour of practice > ten hours of reading.**

---

### Physical Preparation

**Survival is physically demanding:**

- **Cardiovascular fitness** - Can you hike 10 miles? Carry 40 lbs?
- **Functional strength** - Lifting, carrying, digging, building
- **Flexibility** - Prevents injuries when moving through rough terrain
- **Heat/cold tolerance** - Gradual exposure builds resilience

**Start now**: Walk 30 min daily, carry a backpack, do bodyweight exercises.

---

### Mental Preparation

**Mental rehearsal saves lives:**

1. **"What if" scenarios** - "What if earthquake hits during dinner? Fire? Flood?"
2. **Walk through responses** - Where would you go? What would you grab?
3. **Visualize success** - Mentally practice staying calm, taking action
4. **Discuss with family** - Everyone knows the plan, no confusion

**Visualization creates mental pathways** - Your brain treats it like real practice.

---

### Gear Preparation

**Survival gear you don't have with you = useless:**

- **EDC (Every Day Carry)** - Small items always on you (lighter, knife, flashlight)
- **Vehicle kit** - Stays in car (blanket, water, first aid, jumper cables)
- **Home kit** - 72-hour supplies (water, food, radio, first aid)
- **Bug-out bag** - Grab-and-go bag for evacuation

**Test your gear** - Use it BEFORE you need it. Dead batteries kill.

---

## Decision-Making Framework (Applied OODA)

**OODA Loop in practical survival scenarios:**

### Example: Lost While Hiking

**Observe:**
- I don't recognize this trail
- Sun is setting in 2 hours
- Temperature dropping
- I have water, no food, light jacket

**Orient:**
- Last known location was 1 hour ago
- Told spouse I'd be back by 6 PM (rescue will come)
- Cold night ahead (40°F forecast)
- Terrain is rocky, wooded

**Decide:**
- STAY PUT (spouse knows route, rescue likely)
- Build shelter NOW (2 hours until dark)
- Start fire (have lighter, dry wood available)
- Signal location (whistle every 30 min)

**Act:**
- Build debris hut in next 90 min
- Gather firewood for night
- Set up signal area (clear space, reflective items visible)
- Ration water (have enough for 24 hours)

**Loop back to Observe:**
- Shelter built, testing for drafts
- Fire established
- Heard distant voices - signal with whistle
- Rescued 3 hours later

**Key**: STOP before OODA. Panic skips straight to bad actions.

## Context-Specific Priorities

**The Rule of 3s is universal, but context matters:**

### Urban Disaster (Earthquake, Riots, Power Outage)

**Immediate:**
1. Stop gas leaks (if earthquake)
2. Get away from crowds (if riots)
3. Shelter in place or evacuate? (depends on threat)

**Short-term:**
1. Tap water (fill bathtubs before pressure drops)
2. Secure home (board windows, lock doors)
3. Contact family (pre-arranged plan)

**Medium-term:**
1. Neighbor network (mutual aid)
2. Resource management (ration supplies)
3. Information gathering (radio news)

---

### Wilderness Survival (Lost, Injured)

**Immediate:**
1. STOP, calm down
2. Treat injuries
3. Assess weather/shelter needs

**Short-term:**
1. Shelter building
2. Signaling (if rescue likely)
3. Water location

**Medium-term:**
1. Water procurement
2. Fire maintenance
3. Food if extended (week+)

---

### Vehicle Stranded (Breakdown, Blizzard)

**Immediate:**
1. Pull over safely
2. Call for help (if signal)
3. Turn on hazards

**Short-term:**
1. Stay with vehicle (more visible than you on foot)
2. Run engine 10 min/hour (heat but conserve gas)
3. Stay visible (tie cloth to antenna)

**Medium-term:**
1. Ration water/snacks
2. Create insulation (floor mats, seats)
3. Signal passing vehicles

---

## Common Survival Myths (Debunked)

1. **"Moss grows on north side of trees"** → FALSE (grows on moist/shaded side)
2. **"You can drink any clear water"** → FALSE (giardia, parasites invisible)
3. **"Eating snow hydrates you"** → PARTLY FALSE (melts to tiny amount, uses body heat)
4. **"Rub frostbite to warm it"** → DEADLY FALSE (causes tissue damage)
5. **"Suck venom from snake bite"** → FALSE (doesn't work, risks infection)
6. **"You need 8 glasses of water daily"** → CONTEXT DEPENDENT (need more in heat/exertion, less in cold/rest)
7. **"Shelter before water"** → SOMETIMES (depends on weather - harsh conditions yes, mild no)

**Trust evidence-based knowledge, not folklore.**

## Quick Decision Guide

**When in doubt, use this checklist:**

- [ ] Am I in immediate danger? (Move to safety first)
- [ ] Am I injured? (Stop bleeding, stabilize)
- [ ] Is weather a threat? (Build shelter if yes)
- [ ] Should I stay or move? (Stay if rescue likely - 80% of cases)
- [ ] Do I have water? (If no, find within 24 hours)
- [ ] Can I signal for help? (If yes, set up signals)
- [ ] What can I do in next 30 minutes? (Take one productive action)

**One decision, one action at a time.** Don't try to solve everything at once.

---

## Key Takeaway

**Survival = Knowledge × Preparation × Mindset**

You can't control the situation, but you can control your response. Stay calm, prioritize correctly, and execute systematically.

**The best survival strategy**: Prepare before the emergency. Train your skills. Plan with your family. Test your gear. Build mental resilience.

**When emergency hits**: Use what you practiced. Trust your training. Take it one decision at a time. Never give up.
