# Urban Survival - Power Outages, Civil Disruption, Bugging In

**Context**: Most survival scenarios happen at home during infrastructure failures, not in wilderness.

---

## Multi-Day Power Outage (Most Likely Scenario)

### Immediate Actions (First Hour)

1. **Confirm outage scope** - Check neighbors, utility website
2. **Preserve cold** - Don't open fridge/freezer unnecessarily
3. **Fill bathtubs with water** - Before water pumps fail
4. **Charge devices** - Car, battery packs, solar if available
5. **Gather flashlights/candles** - Locate before dark
6. **Check on neighbors** - Especially elderly, medical needs

### First 24 Hours

**Food**:
- Fridge stays cold ~4 hours (unopened)
- Freezer stays frozen ~48 hours (full), ~24 hours (half full)
- Eat refrigerated food first, then frozen
- Use coolers + ice/snow if available

**Water**:
- Water heater = 40-80 gallons reserve
- Fill containers from tap while pressure lasts
- Bathtub = 30-50 gallons (but water quality degrades)
- Assume water treatment plants fail after 24-48 hours

**Heat** (Winter):
- Close off rooms, heat one space
- Hang blankets over doorways
- Body heat + insulation (layers, sleeping bags)
- **DANGER**: Propane/kerosene heaters need ventilation (carbon monoxide)
- **NEVER**: Run generator or grill indoors

**Cooling** (Summer):
- Open windows at night, close during day
- Wet towels + fan (if battery power)
- Stay in basement (coolest)
- Hydrate constantly

### Days 2-7

**Food Planning**:
1. Refrigerated items (days 1-2)
2. Frozen items (days 2-4)
3. Canned/dry goods (days 5+)
4. Ration high-calorie items

**Sanitation** (If Water Stops):
- Toilet: Flush with bucket of water (pour into bowl)
- No water: Line toilet with plastic bag, dispose outside
- Hand hygiene: Sanitizer, wet wipes
- Trash: Bag and remove from living space (attracts pests)

**Communication**:
- Battery/hand-crank radio for news
- Car for charging phones (run 10 min/hour)
- Text > calls (less power, more reliable in congestion)
- Designate out-of-state contact (local lines may be down)

## Urban Water Sources

### In Your Home

1. **Water heater** (40-80 gal) - Drain from bottom valve
2. **Toilet tanks** (not bowls) - 3-5 gal per tank
3. **Pipes** - Turn off main valve, open lowest faucet to drain pipes
4. **Ice in freezer** - Melts to drinking water
5. **Canned goods** - Vegetables, fruits contain liquid

### In Your Neighborhood

1. **Swimming pools** - Purify before drinking (chlorine ≠ purified)
2. **Ponds/creeks** - Must purify (high contamination in urban areas)
3. **Rainwater** - Collect from roof gutters (filter first)
4. **Hot water from apartment buildings** - Basement boilers

---

## Food Without Refrigeration

### Preservation Methods

**Room Temperature Safe** (use within 24-48 hours):
- Peanut butter, jelly, bread
- Canned goods (after opening, consume quickly)
- Dry goods (rice, pasta, crackers)
- Honey (never spoils)

**Curing/Drying** (extend life):
- Hang meat in cold, dry area (winter only)
- Salt cure (heavy salt coating)
- Smoke (if you have fire and ability)

### Cooking Without Power

1. **Gas stove** - Works if you have matches (electronic ignition fails)
2. **Grill** (outside only)
3. **Camping stove** (propane/butane)
4. **Fireplace** (if you have one)
5. **Tea candles** (can heat soup slowly)

**Never Indoors**: Charcoal, propane grills (carbon monoxide kills)

## Home Security During Civil Disruption

### Deterrence (Make Your Home Unappealing)

**Visible**:
- Boarded windows (implies prepared/defended)
- "Nothing to take" appearance
- Avoid showing lights at night (advertises supplies)

**Invisible**:
- Solid doors with deadbolts
- Window locks, dowels in sliding tracks
- Neighborhood watch coordination

### Defense Layers

1. **Perimeter**: Fence, hedges, motion lights (if power)
2. **Entry points**: Reinforced doors, security film on windows
3. **Safe room**: Interior room with supplies, communication
4. **Escape route**: Planned exit if situation deteriorates

### Gray Man Principle

- Don't advertise preps (no visible stockpiles)
- Blend in with neighbors
- Don't discuss supplies publicly
- Share cautiously (creates dependency/resentment)

## Bugging In vs. Bugging Out

### Bug In (Stay Home) When:

- Infrastructure failure but no immediate danger
- Home is defensible and supplied
- Roads are dangerous/blocked
- You have elderly/medical needs
- Weather is severe

### Bug Out (Evacuate) When:

- Wildfire, flood, chemical spill (immediate danger)
- Civil unrest in your area
- Authorities order evacuation
- Home is compromised (no heat in winter, etc.)
- You have safe destination

**Most scenarios = bug in.** Only evacuate if staying is more dangerous than leaving.

## Communication Without Internet/Cell

### Methods

1. **Ham radio** (requires license, equipment)
   - VHF/UHF for local (5-50 miles)
   - HF for long distance (hundreds of miles)
   - Handheld radios (Baofeng) ~$30

2. **CB radio** (no license needed)
   - 4-5 mile range
   - Good for local coordination

3. **FRS/GMRS walkie-talkies**
   - 1-2 mile range in urban areas
   - Family communication

4. **Physical notes**
   - Leave messages at home
   - Chalk marks on sidewalk (pre-arranged codes)

### Pre-arranged Plans

**Family Communication Plan**:
- Rally point if separated
- Out-of-state contact person
- Check-in times (daily at noon, etc.)
- Code words for "safe" vs "danger"

---

## Apartment-Specific Challenges

### Water

- No water heater access? Use toilet tanks, pipes
- Collect from roof (if accessible)
- Coordinate with neighbors (share resources)

### Heat/Cooling

- Fewer windows = less heat loss (good in winter)
- Higher floors = hotter in summer (stay low)
- Shared walls = some passive heat from neighbors

### Security

- Single entry point (good for defense)
- Fire escape as secondary exit
- Hallway vulnerability (hard to see threats)

### Sanitation

- No yard for waste disposal
- Bag trash, store in balcony/far room
- Coordinate building-wide sanitation

---

## Realistic Timeline Expectations

### 72 Hours (3 Days)

- Most outages resolve in 1-3 days
- Fridge/freezer food still viable
- Water may still flow
- Emergency services still functioning

**Goal**: Ride it out comfortably

### 1-2 Weeks

- Extended winter storm, regional disaster
- Water/sewage may fail
- Stores empty/closed
- Emergency services overwhelmed

**Goal**: Sustain household without resupply

### 2+ Weeks (Rare)

- Major disaster (hurricane, earthquake)
- Complete infrastructure failure
- Potential civil disorder
- Supply chains broken

**Goal**: Community coordination, potential evacuation

---

## Essential Supplies (Urban Context)

### Immediate Use (0-72 hours)

- **Water**: 1 gallon/person/day × 3 days
- **Food**: No-cook items (granola, jerky, PB)
- **Light**: Flashlights, headlamps, batteries
- **Heat**: Blankets, sleeping bags, layers
- **Communication**: Battery radio, phone chargers
- **Sanitation**: Toilet paper, wipes, bags
- **Cash**: ATMs/cards won't work

### Extended (1-2 weeks)

- **Water**: Purification tablets, filter
- **Food**: Canned goods, dry staples
- **Cooking**: Camp stove, fuel
- **Medical**: First aid, prescriptions
- **Security**: Locks, deterrents
- **Entertainment**: Books, games (morale)

### Optional (Nice to Have)

- Generator (propane, need ventilation)
- Solar chargers
- Ham radio setup
- Fireplace/wood stove

---

## Hygiene Without Running Water

**Personal**:
- Wet wipes for daily cleaning
- Dry shampoo (or baby powder)
- Hand sanitizer (60%+ alcohol)
- Baking soda (deodorant, toothpaste)

**Dishes**:
- Paper plates (conserve water)
- Sanitize with bleach water (1 tbsp/gallon)
- Rinse in three buckets (wash, rinse, sanitize)

**Laundry**:
- Wear clothes multiple days
- Spot clean with damp cloth
- Bucket wash if water available (labor-intensive)

---

## Psychological Survival

### Routine Maintenance

- Wake/sleep consistent times
- Structured activities (not just survival tasks)
- Physical exercise (reduces stress)
- Social interaction (family games, conversation)

### Morale Boosters

- Comfort foods (ration chocolate, treats)
- Entertainment (books, cards, board games)
- Small luxuries (coffee, tea)
- Laughter (stories, jokes)

**Why**: Despair is contagious and debilitating. Maintain normalcy where possible.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Most survival = urban, not wilderness** - Prepare for infrastructure failure
2. **Bug in is default** - Only evacuate if staying is more dangerous
3. **Water heater = hidden reservoir** - 40-80 gallons most people forget
4. **Gray man principle** - Don't advertise your preparedness
5. **First 72 hours are critical** - Have supplies to ride out without help
6. **Community > lone wolf** - Coordinate with trustworthy neighbors
7. **Morale matters** - Psychological collapse kills as much as physical needs
