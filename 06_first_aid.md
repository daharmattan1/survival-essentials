# First Aid - Critical Injuries, Common Ailments, Natural Remedies

**Critical**: Medical emergencies are the most likely survival scenario. Master these basics.

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER**: This guide is NOT a substitute for professional first aid training. Take a Red Cross First Aid/CPR course. Reading about medical procedures ≠ competency to perform them. When in doubt, seek professional medical help.

## Emergency Response Priority: ABC

**In any medical emergency, assess in this order:**

1. **A - Airway**: Is the airway clear? Can they breathe?
2. **B - Breathing**: Are they breathing? Is breathing adequate?
3. **C - Circulation**: Do they have a pulse? Are they bleeding severely?

**If any of these fail, address immediately before treating other injuries.**

## Life-Threatening Emergencies (Address First)

### 1. Severe Bleeding (Hemorrhage Control)

**Recognition:**
- Bright red, spurting blood = arterial (most dangerous)
- Dark red, flowing blood = venous (serious)
- Blood soaking through clothing rapidly
- Large blood pool forming

**Treatment Steps:**

1. **Direct Pressure (FIRST LINE)**
   - Apply firm, direct pressure to wound
   - Use cleanest available cloth/bandage
   - Press hard - harder than you think
   - Maintain pressure for minimum 10 minutes (no peeking)
   - If blood soaks through, add more cloth on top (don't remove original)

2. **Elevate if possible**
   - Raise injured area above heart level (if no fracture suspected)
   - Helps reduce blood flow to area
   - Maintain direct pressure while elevating

3. **Pressure Points (if direct pressure insufficient)**
   - **Arm bleeding**: Press brachial artery (inside upper arm against bone)
   - **Leg bleeding**: Press femoral artery (groin crease, against pelvis)
   - Use while maintaining direct pressure

4. **Tourniquet (LAST RESORT - limb-threatening bleeding only)**
   - **When**: Arterial bleeding you cannot control with pressure, amputation, crushed limb
   - **Where**: 2-3 inches above wound, on bone (not on joint)
   - **How**:
     - Use commercial tourniquet (preferred) or improvise with belt/cloth (min 1.5" wide)
     - Wrap twice around limb, tie half-knot
     - Place stick/rod on knot, tie full knot over it
     - Twist stick until bleeding stops
     - Secure stick so it can't unwind
     - Write time applied on tourniquet or victim's forehead
   - **Critical**: Once applied, DO NOT REMOVE (only medical personnel should remove)
   - **Warning**: Improper tourniquet use can cause permanent damage/amputation

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Lifting bandage to "check" (breaks clot formation)
- ❌ Not applying enough pressure (be firm)
- ❌ Using tourniquet too early (exhaust pressure options first)
- ❌ Applying tourniquet too loose (worse than none)

---

### 2. Choking (Heimlich Maneuver)

**Recognition:**
- Universal choking sign (hands on throat)
- Cannot speak/cough/breathe
- Face turning red/blue
- Panicked expression

**For Conscious Adult:**

1. Stand behind person
2. Make fist with one hand, place thumb-side against abdomen (above navel, below ribcage)
3. Grasp fist with other hand
4. Give quick, upward thrusts (like trying to lift them off ground)
5. Repeat until object dislodges or person becomes unconscious

**If person becomes unconscious:**
- Lower them to ground
- Call for help
- Begin CPR (chest compressions may dislodge object)

**For yourself (if alone):**
- Use your own fists (same technique)
- Or lean over chair back/counter edge and thrust abdomen against it

**For infants (under 1 year):**
- DO NOT use Heimlich
- 5 back blows (between shoulder blades)
- 5 chest thrusts (two fingers, center of chest)
- Alternate until object dislodges

---

### 3. CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)

**When to use**: Person is unresponsive AND not breathing (or only gasping)

**⚠️ Proper CPR training is essential. This is a reference, not training.**

**Steps (Adult CPR - Compression-Only Method):**

1. **Check responsiveness**
   - Tap shoulders, shout "Are you okay?"
   - If no response, proceed

2. **Call for help**
   - Yell for someone to call 911
   - If alone, call 911 on speaker, then start CPR

3. **Position**
   - Lay person flat on firm surface
   - Kneel beside chest

4. **Hand placement**
   - Place heel of one hand on center of chest (between nipples)
   - Place other hand on top, interlace fingers
   - Keep arms straight, shoulders over hands

5. **Compressions**
   - Push hard, push fast - minimum 2 inches deep
   - Rate: 100-120 per minute (beat of "Stayin' Alive" song)
   - Allow chest to recoil fully between compressions
   - Minimize interruptions

6. **Continue until**
   - Person shows signs of life (breathing, movement)
   - Professional help arrives
   - You're physically unable to continue
   - Scene becomes unsafe

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Not pushing hard enough (2" minimum depth for adults)
- ❌ Not pushing fast enough (100-120/min)
- ❌ Not letting chest recoil fully
- ❌ Stopping compressions to check pulse (don't stop unless signs of life)

**Note**: Rescue breaths (mouth-to-mouth) are optional for bystanders. Compression-only CPR is effective and eliminates hesitation/disease transmission concerns.

---

### 4. Shock (Medical Shock - Life Threatening)

**Recognition:**
- Pale, cold, clammy skin
- Rapid, weak pulse
- Rapid, shallow breathing
- Confusion, anxiety
- Weakness, dizziness
- Possible unconsciousness

**Common causes**: Severe bleeding, severe burns, allergic reaction, heart attack, severe infection

**Treatment:**

1. **Treat underlying cause** (stop bleeding, etc.)
2. **Lay person down** (unless vomiting or breathing difficulty)
3. **Elevate legs** 12" (if no spinal injury/broken legs)
4. **Keep warm** (cover with blanket, prevent heat loss)
5. **Reassure** (reduce anxiety)
6. **Nothing by mouth** (no food/water - may need surgery)
7. **Monitor** (breathing, pulse, consciousness)
8. **Get medical help** (shock is life-threatening)

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Give anything to drink (aspiration risk)
- ❌ Move person unnecessarily
- ❌ Assume they're "just scared" (shock can kill)

## Serious (But Not Immediately Life-Threatening) Injuries

### 5. Wound Care (Cuts, Lacerations, Punctures)

**Immediate care:**

1. **Stop bleeding** (see severe bleeding section above)

2. **Clean wound**
   - Rinse with clean/purified water (running water ideal)
   - Gently remove visible dirt/debris
   - Don't scrub deep wounds (causes more damage)
   - Soap around wound edges (not inside deep wounds)

3. **Apply antibiotic ointment** (if available)
   - Triple antibiotic (Neosporin, etc.)
   - Thin layer over wound
   - Helps prevent infection

4. **Bandage**
   - Cover with sterile gauze/clean cloth
   - Secure with tape or wrap
   - Change daily or when wet/dirty

5. **Monitor for infection** (days 2-5 most critical)

**Infection signs (seek medical help if present):**
- Red streaks spreading from wound
- Increasing pain, warmth, swelling
- Pus (yellow/green discharge)
- Fever
- Red area expanding beyond immediate wound

**When to seek medical help immediately:**
- Deep wounds (can see fat, muscle, bone)
- Won't stop bleeding after 15 min direct pressure
- Gaping wounds (may need stitches)
- Puncture wounds (especially if dirty object)
- Animal/human bites (high infection risk)
- Wounds with embedded objects (don't remove - stabilize)

### 6. Burns

**Burn Degrees:**
- **1st degree**: Red, painful (like sunburn) - skin intact
- **2nd degree**: Blisters, very painful - partial skin loss
- **3rd degree**: White/charred, may not hurt (nerves destroyed) - full skin loss

**Treatment:**

**For 1st & minor 2nd degree burns:**
1. **Cool the burn**
   - Run cool (not ice cold) water over burn for 10-20 min
   - Or apply cool, wet cloth
   - Stops burning process, reduces pain

2. **Cover loosely**
   - After cooling, cover with sterile gauze
   - Don't pop blisters (infection risk)

3. **Pain relief**
   - Ibuprofen or acetaminophen
   - Aloe vera gel (after cooling)

4. **Monitor for infection**

**For 3rd degree or extensive 2nd degree burns:**
- **Seek medical help immediately**
- Cover with clean, dry cloth
- Do NOT apply ointments
- Treat for shock
- Don't remove clothing stuck to burn

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Apply ice directly (causes more tissue damage)
- ❌ Pop blisters (infection highway)
- ❌ Apply butter, oil, or home remedies (traps heat)
- ❌ Remove clothing stuck to burn (causes more damage)

### 7. Fractures & Sprains

**Fracture recognition:**
- Deformity (limb at wrong angle)
- Severe pain
- Swelling, bruising
- Cannot bear weight/use limb
- Bone protruding (open fracture)
- Grinding/crunching sensation

**Sprain recognition:**
- Pain, swelling, bruising
- Limited mobility
- Can sometimes bear weight (unlike fracture)

**Treatment (assume fracture if uncertain):**

1. **Immobilize**
   - Splint in position found (don't straighten unless cutting off circulation)
   - Splint should immobilize joints above and below break
   - Use: sticks, rolled newspaper, foam pad, SAM splint

2. **Padding**
   - Pad splint with cloth (prevents pressure sores)
   - Secure with bandages/cloth strips (not too tight)

3. **Elevate**
   - Raise above heart level (reduces swelling)
   - Apply ice if available (20 min on, 20 min off)

4. **Check circulation**
   - After splinting, check fingers/toes every 30 min
   - Should be pink, warm, can move them
   - If blue/cold/numb = splint too tight, loosen

5. **Pain management**
   - Ibuprofen (reduces pain + inflammation)
   - Immobilization reduces pain

**Open Fracture (bone protruding):**
- DO NOT push bone back in
- Cover wound with sterile dressing
- Splint as is
- Seek medical help immediately (infection + bleeding risk)

**RICE method for sprains:**
- **R**est (don't use injured area)
- **I**ce (20 min on/off for first 48 hrs)
- **C**ompression (wrap with elastic bandage)
- **E**levation (above heart level)

---

### 8. Head Injuries & Concussion

**Seek immediate medical help if:**
- Loss of consciousness (any duration)
- Severe headache that worsens
- Repeated vomiting
- Confusion, disorientation
- Slurred speech
- Unequal pupil sizes
- Weakness, numbness
- Seizures
- Clear fluid from nose/ears

**If medical help is delayed:**
- Keep person awake for first few hours (monitor condition)
- Check responsiveness every 15-30 min
- Watch for worsening symptoms
- No aspirin (increases bleeding risk)
- Acetaminophen for headache (if mild)

**Myth**: You don't need to keep someone awake after concussion - but DO monitor them closely for first 24 hours

---

## Common Ailments

### 9. Dehydration

**Recognition:**
- **Mild**: Thirst, dry mouth, dark urine
- **Moderate**: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, very dark urine
- **Severe**: Confusion, rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes, no urination, unconsciousness

**Treatment:**
1. Drink water slowly (sips, not gulps)
2. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) better than plain water:
   - Mix: 1 liter water + 6 tsp sugar + 1/2 tsp salt
   - Rehydrates faster than water alone
3. Rest in shade/cool area
4. Avoid alcohol, caffeine

**Prevention:**
- Drink before you're thirsty
- Urine should be light yellow (not clear, not dark)
- In heat/exertion: 1 liter per hour

---

### 10. Diarrhea (Major Survival Concern)

**Why it's dangerous**: Leads to rapid dehydration, which kills

**Treatment:**
1. **Hydration is critical**
   - ORS (see dehydration section)
   - Small sips frequently
2. Rest
3. Bland foods if eating (rice, bananas, toast)
4. Avoid dairy, fatty foods

**Anti-diarrheal (Imodium):**
- Use if: Need to travel, can't rest
- Don't use if: Bloody stool, high fever (may be infection that needs to pass)

**Seek help if:**
- Blood in stool
- High fever
- Severe abdominal pain
- Signs of severe dehydration
- Lasts >3 days

---

### 11. Blisters

**Prevention > Treatment:**
- Address hot spots immediately (cover with tape/moleskin before blister forms)
- Well-fitting boots
- Moisture-wicking socks

**If blister forms:**

**Small, unbroken blister:**
- Leave intact (natural protection)
- Cover with moleskin/bandage

**Large, painful blister (interfering with walking):**
1. Clean area with alcohol/soap
2. Sterilize needle (flame, then let cool)
3. Puncture edge of blister (small hole)
4. Drain fluid (don't remove skin roof)
5. Apply antibiotic ointment
6. Cover with bandage
7. Monitor for infection

## Environmental Injuries

### 12. Hypothermia

**Recognition:**
- **Mild**: Shivering, cold hands/feet, slight confusion
- **Moderate**: Violent shivering, very clumsy, moderate confusion
- **Severe**: Shivering stops, very confused/irrational, drowsy, weak pulse

**Treatment:**
1. **Get out of cold/wet**
2. **Remove wet clothing**
3. **Warm gradually**
   - Warm, dry clothing/blankets
   - Warm drinks (if conscious, not confused)
   - Body-to-body contact (skin-to-skin in sleeping bag)
4. **Warm core first** (chest, neck, head, groin)
5. **Do NOT**:
   - Give alcohol (causes heat loss)
   - Rub extremities (can cause heart issues)
   - Use direct heat on extremities (hot water bottles, fire)

**Severe hypothermia = medical emergency**

---

### 13. Heat Exhaustion & Heat Stroke

**Heat Exhaustion (Serious):**
- Heavy sweating
- Weakness, dizziness
- Nausea
- Headache
- Cool, clammy skin

**Treatment:**
- Move to shade/cool area
- Remove excess clothing
- Cool with wet cloths
- Drink water slowly
- Rest

**Heat Stroke (LIFE-THREATENING):**
- High body temp (>104°F)
- Hot, DRY skin (sweating stopped)
- Confusion, altered mental state
- Rapid pulse
- Possible unconsciousness

**Treatment:**
- Call for help immediately
- Move to shade
- Cool aggressively (water, wet cloths, fanning)
- Do NOT give fluids if confused/unconscious

## Natural Remedies (Use With Caution)

**These are NOT substitutes for proper medical treatment. Use only when modern medicine unavailable.**

### Willow Bark (Natural Aspirin)
- **Use**: Pain, fever, inflammation
- **How**: Chew bark or make tea (boil bark 10-15 min)
- **Caution**: Same risks as aspirin (stomach issues, blood thinning)

### Honey
- **Use**: Wound dressing (antibacterial), cough suppressant
- **How**: Apply directly to clean wound, cover with bandage
- **Evidence**: Scientifically proven antibacterial properties

### Plantain Leaves (Plantago, not banana)
- **Use**: Insect bites, minor wounds
- **How**: Crush fresh leaves, apply to bite/wound
- **Evidence**: Anti-inflammatory properties

### Yarrow
- **Use**: Stop bleeding, wound care
- **How**: Crush leaves, apply to wound
- **Caution**: Allergic reactions possible

### Pine Needle Tea
- **Use**: Vitamin C source (prevents scurvy)
- **How**: Steep fresh pine needles in hot water
- **Caution**: Some pine species toxic (avoid Norfolk Island Pine, Yew)

**General Rule**: Don't experiment with plants unless you're 100% certain of identification. Misidentification can kill.

## Key Principles

1. **ABC always comes first** - Airway, Breathing, Circulation
2. **Stop catastrophic bleeding** - You can survive without a limb, not without blood
3. **Prevention > Treatment** - Avoid injuries when possible
4. **Clean wounds immediately** - Infection kills slowly but surely
5. **Monitor for infection** - Check wounds daily for red flags
6. **When in doubt, seek help** - Pride doesn't save lives

**Remember**: This guide provides knowledge for emergencies when professional help is unavailable. Take a real first aid course - hands-on practice with feedback is essential for competency.
