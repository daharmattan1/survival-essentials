# Food - Foraging, Growing, Hunting, Fishing, Preservation

**Remember**: You can survive 3 weeks without food. Water and shelter come first.

**Priority**: Focus on high-calorie, low-effort food sources. Energy spent > calories gained = death spiral.

---

## Realistic Food Timeline

- **Days 1-3**: Eat stored/preserved food, don't waste energy foraging
- **Days 4-7**: Light foraging, fishing (passive traps)
- **Week 2+**: Hunting/trapping, serious foraging, consider gardening
- **Month 2+**: Gardening becomes viable food source

## Plant Identification & Foraging

### Universal Edibility Test (Last Resort Only)

**Only use if you have NO other options and cannot positively identify plant.**

1. **Separate plant into parts** (leaves, stems, roots, flowers)
2. **Smell test**: Avoid strong/acrid smells (almonds = cyanide)
3. **Skin test**: Rub on inner elbow, wait 15 min for reaction
4. **Lip test**: Touch to lips, wait 3 min for burning/itching
5. **Tongue test**: Place on tongue, wait 15 min
6. **Chew test**: Chew (don't swallow), wait 15 min
7. **Swallow small amount**: Wait 5 hours, monitor for nausea/cramping
8. **Eat normal portion**: If no reaction, plant part is likely safe

**WARNING**: Takes 24+ hours per plant part. Use only in true survival situations.

---

## Fishing (Highest Calorie Return for Effort)

### Passive Methods (Best for Survival)

**Trotline**
- **Setup**: String line across stream, attach multiple baited hooks
- **Check**: Every 12 hours
- **Bait**: Worms, insects, small fish pieces
- **Advantage**: Works while you do other tasks

**Fish Trap (Weir)**
- **Setup**: Build funnel-shaped rock/stick enclosure in stream
- **How**: Fish swim in, can't find exit
- **Check**: Daily
- **Best**: Tidal areas, streams with fish runs

**Bank/Jug Lines**
- **Setup**: Tie line to bank or floating jug, baited hook
- **Check**: Morning and evening
- **Advantage**: Multiple lines increase odds

### Active Methods

**Hand Line**
- **Setup**: Paracord or fishing line, hook, sinker, bait
- **Technique**: Cast, wait, feel for bites
- **Time investment**: 2-4 hours per session
- **Best**: When you have reliable fishing spot

**Spearfishing (Gig)**
- **Setup**: Sharp stick (fire-hardened tip) or multi-prong gig
- **Technique**: Wade slowly, stab fish quickly
- **Difficulty**: High (practice required)
- **Best**: Clear, shallow water

**Net** (if available)
- **Cast net**: Throw over school of fish
- **Seine net**: Drag between two people
- **Gill net**: Set in stream, fish swim into mesh

### Bait

**Best baits**:
- Worms (dig near water)
- Grasshoppers, crickets
- Grubs (under rotting logs)
- Small fish pieces
- Bread dough (if you have flour)

### Fish Preparation

1. **Gut immediately**: Cut from anus to gills, remove organs
2. **Scale or skin**: Scrape scales off or skin (catfish, bullhead)
3. **Cook thoroughly**: Parasites common in wild fish
4. **Preserve excess**: Smoke, salt, or dry

## Hunting & Trapping

### Realistic Expectations

**Hunting with primitive weapons = very difficult**
- Requires practice, patience, and luck
- Energy cost often exceeds calorie gain
- Focus on trapping (passive) over hunting (active)

### Small Game Trapping (Best ROI)

**Simple Snare**
- **Target**: Rabbits, squirrels
- **Setup**: Wire loop on game trail, attached to spring pole or stake
- **Height**: 1-2 fist widths above ground
- **Check**: Daily (avoid animal suffering, meat spoilage)

**Deadfall Trap**
- **Target**: Small rodents, rabbits
- **Setup**: Heavy rock/log balanced on trigger stick
- **Bait**: Seeds, vegetables, peanut butter
- **Trigger**: Figure-4 or Paiute deadfall

**Box Trap**
- **Target**: Rabbits, possums
- **Setup**: Box with door triggered by bait
- **Advantage**: Catch alive (fresh meat when needed)

### Finding Game

**Signs to look for**:
- Trails (packed dirt, worn vegetation)
- Droppings (fresh = active area)
- Tracks (mud, snow, soft soil)
- Feeding signs (gnawed bark, scattered nuts)

**Best locations**:
- Water sources (animals must drink)
- Transition zones (forest edge to field)
- Natural funnels (between obstacles)

### Processing Game

**Small game (rabbit, squirrel)**:
1. Skin (peel like removing a shirt)
2. Gut (remove all organs)
3. Remove head, feet
4. Cook immediately or preserve

**Never eat**:
- Brain, spinal tissue (prion diseases)
- Organs (liver can be toxic)
- Sick-looking animals (lesions, discolored organs)

**Cook thoroughly**: Parasites and bacteria common

## Growing Food (Long-term)

### Survival Garden Priorities

**Focus on**:
- **High calorie crops** (potatoes, beans, corn)
- **Fast-growing** (radishes, lettuce in 30 days)
- **Nutrient-dense** (kale, spinach)
- **Storable** (squash, onions, root vegetables)

**Avoid**:
- Low-calorie crops (celery, cucumbers)
- Long-season crops (unless you have time)
- Difficult crops (cauliflower, artichokes)

### Top 10 Survival Crops

**1. Potatoes**
- **Calories**: Very high (starchy)

### Basic Gardening (Emergency Scenario)

**Minimum viable garden**:
- 10×10 ft plot per person (100 sq ft)
- 5-6 crops (variety for nutrition)
- Potatoes, beans, kale, carrots, onions

**Steps**:
1. **Clear area**: Remove grass, weeds
2. **Loosen soil**: Dig or till 8-12 inches deep
3. **Add compost**: If available (improves soil)
4. **Plant in rows**: Space per seed packet directions
5. **Water regularly**: 1 inch per week (rain or manual)
6. **Weed weekly**: Competition kills crops
7. **Harvest**: Don't wait too long (overripe = less productive)

### Seed Saving

**Easy to save seeds**:
- Beans, peas (dry pods, store seeds)
- Tomatoes (ferment seeds, dry, store)
- Peppers (dry pods, extract seeds)
- Lettuce (let bolt, collect seeds)

**Store seeds**:
- Cool, dry, dark location
- Sealed container (jar, envelope)
- Label with variety and year
- Viability: 2-5 years for most

## Food Preservation (Without Refrigeration)

### Drying (Dehydration)

**Best for**: Fruits, vegetables, meat (jerky), fish

**Methods**:
- **Sun drying**: Lay on screen in direct sun, cover with mesh (flies)
- **Air drying**: Hang in dry, airy location (garlic, onions, herbs)
- **Fire drying**: Hang near fire (not in smoke unless smoking)

**Indicators of done**:
- Brittle or leathery texture
- No moisture when squeezed
- Lightweight

**Storage**: Airtight container, cool and dark

### Smoking

**Best for**: Meat, fish

**Setup**:
- Build small fire (hardwood, not pine)
- Create smoke chamber (hung meat above, enclosed)
- Low heat, heavy smoke
- Time: 6-24 hours depending on thickness

**Types**:
- **Hot smoking**: 150-200°F, cooks and smokes (eat soon)
- **Cold smoking**: 70-90°F, preserves longer (traditional jerky)

### Salting

**Best for**: Meat, fish

**Method**:
- Cover meat heavily with salt (creates hostile environment for bacteria)
- Layer: meat, salt, meat, salt
- Weight down to extract moisture
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Rinse before cooking (very salty)

**Salt ratio**: 1 lb salt per 5 lbs meat

### Root Cellaring

**Best for**: Root vegetables, squash, apples, onions

**Setup**:
- Cool (32-40°F), dark, humid (80-90%)
- Basement, underground pit, buried container
- Ventilation to prevent mold

**Storage times**:
- Potatoes: 4-6 months
- Carrots (in sand): 4-6 months
- Winter squash: 3-6 months
- Onions (cured): 6-8 months

## Caloric Reality Check

**Daily calorie needs**: 2,000-3,000 (more in cold or high activity)

**Wild food calories** (per hour of foraging):
- Berries: 200-500 calories/hour
- Acorns: 1,000-2,000 calories/hour (but processing time)
- Greens (dandelion, plantain): 50-100 calories/hour

**Fishing** (passive trotline):
- 1 fish = 200-500 calories
- Check line 2x/day = minimal effort

**Hunting/Trapping**:
- Rabbit = 500-800 calories
- Squirrel = 200-400 calories
- But: energy to hunt/check traps

**Gardening**:
- 1 potato = 150-200 calories
- 10×10 plot = thousands of calories over season
- But: 90-120 days to harvest

---

## Poisoning Symptoms (Seek Help Immediately)

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (within 1-6 hours)
- Abdominal cramping
- Dizziness, confusion
- Difficulty breathing
- Rapid heartbeat or irregular heartbeat
- Sweating, salivation

**Action**: Induce vomiting (if conscious), drink water, seek medical help.

## Quick Reference Decision Tree

```
Need food?
├─ Have stored food? → Eat that first (conserve energy)
├─ Near water? → Fish (passive traps = best ROI)
├─ See safe wild edibles? → Forage (if 100% certain of ID)
├─ Week 2+? → Set snare traps (check daily)
└─ Long-term? → Plant survival garden (potatoes, beans, kale)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Positive ID or don't eat** - "When in doubt, go without"
2. **Fishing > foraging > hunting** - Calories per effort ratio
3. **Focus on calorie-dense foods** - Greens won't keep you alive
4. **Universal edibility test = last resort** - Takes 24+ hours per plant part
5. **Garden if you have 90+ days** - Potatoes and beans are survival MVPs
6. **Preservation = force multiplier** - Dry, smoke, or salt excess food
7. **Never eat white/yellow berries** - Red/black/blue *might* be safe (still verify)
8. **Cook all wild meat thoroughly** - Parasites are common
