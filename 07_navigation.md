# Navigation - Without GPS, Celestial, Terrain Reading

**Context**: GPS/cell signal fails. Power grids down. You need to find your way using analog methods.

**Core Principle**: Most lost people should STAY PUT. Moving when lost usually makes things worse. Navigation is for when you must move.

---

## Critical Decision: Stay Put or Move?

### STAY PUT if:
- ✅ You told someone where you're going
- ✅ Rescue is likely within 72 hours
- ✅ You have shelter, water access
- ✅ You're injured or conditions are harsh
- ✅ You're unsure which direction to go

**Staying put is the right call 80% of the time.** Searchers know where you planned to be. Moving creates a larger search area.

### MOVE if:
- ✅ No one knows you're missing
- ✅ You know which direction to safety (confident, not guessing)
- ✅ Staying = certain death (no water, extreme conditions)
- ✅ You have navigation skills and tools

**If you must move:**
- Leave markers showing your direction
- Move slowly and deliberately
- Use multiple navigation methods (cross-check)
- Mark your trail (cairns, broken branches, blazes)

## Sun Navigation

### 1. Shadow Stick Method (Most Reliable Daytime Method)

**Accuracy**: ±10-15° (good enough for wilderness navigation)

**What you need**: Stick (2-3 ft), 2 small rocks/markers, 15-20 minutes

**Steps:**

1. **Plant stick vertically in flat, sunny ground**
   - Make it as vertical as possible
   - Needs to cast clear shadow

2. **Mark first shadow tip**
   - Place rock/marker at tip of shadow
   - This is your WEST marker

3. **Wait 15-20 minutes**
   - Shadow will move (earth rotates)
   - Longer wait = more accurate

4. **Mark second shadow tip**
   - Place second marker at new shadow tip
   - This is your EAST marker

5. **Draw your compass**
   - Line between markers points EAST-WEST
   - Stand with first marker (west) on left, second (east) on right
   - You're now facing NORTH

**Why this works**: Sun moves east to west, so shadows move west to east.

**Best times**: Morning or afternoon (faster shadow movement). Noon shadows barely move.

---

### 2. Watch as Compass (Northern Hemisphere)

**Accuracy**: ±15° (better than guessing, worse than shadow stick)

**Requirements**: Analog watch (or draw clock face), sun visible

**Steps:**

1. **Point hour hand at sun**
   - Hold watch flat
   - Rotate watch so hour hand points directly at sun

2. **Find the midpoint**
   - Bisect angle between hour hand and 12 o'clock
   - Midpoint line points SOUTH
   - Opposite direction = NORTH

**Example**: At 4:00 PM:
- Point 4 at sun
- Angle between 4 and 12 = bisected at roughly 2
- Line through 2 points south

**Digital watch?** Draw clock face on paper with current time, use same method.

**Southern Hemisphere**: Point 12 at sun, bisect between 12 and hour hand = NORTH

---

### 3. Sun Path Basics (Quick Rough Directions)

**Northern Hemisphere:**
- Sun rises in EAST (slightly north in summer, south in winter)
- Sun sets in WEST (slightly north in summer, south in winter)
- Sun at highest point = SOUTH (noon-ish)

**Southern Hemisphere:**
- Same east/west, but highest point = NORTH

**Equator**: Sun nearly directly overhead at noon (less useful)

**Limitations**: Only gives rough directions, varies by season/latitude.

---

## Star Navigation (Night)

### 4. North Star (Polaris) - Northern Hemisphere

**Accuracy**: ±1° (extremely accurate)

**Visibility**: Only Northern Hemisphere (not visible below equator)

**Finding Polaris:**

1. **Locate Big Dipper** (7 bright stars forming ladle/plow shape)
   - One of most recognizable constellations
   - Rotates around North Star throughout night

2. **Find pointer stars**
   - Two stars forming far edge of "cup" (away from handle)
   - Called Dubhe and Merak

3. **Follow the pointers**
   - Draw imaginary line through pointer stars
   - Extend line upward about 5x the distance between pointers
   - First moderately bright star you hit = Polaris (North Star)

4. **Verify with Cassiopeia**
   - Polaris is also between Big Dipper and Cassiopeia (W-shaped constellation)
   - If you found Polaris correctly, Cassiopeia should be on opposite side

**Direction**: Polaris marks TRUE NORTH (within 1°)
- Stand facing Polaris = facing north
- Behind you = south
- Right = east
- Left = west

**Important**: Polaris is NOT the brightest star (common misconception). It's medium brightness.

---

### 5. Southern Cross - Southern Hemisphere

**Accuracy**: ±5° (very good)

**Visibility**: Only Southern Hemisphere

**Finding South using Southern Cross:**

1. **Locate Southern Cross**
   - 4 bright stars forming cross/kite shape
   - Smaller than you'd expect (don't confuse with "False Cross")

2. **Extend the long axis**
   - Draw line through long axis of cross
   - Extend about 4.5x the length of the cross

3. **Drop to horizon**
   - Where this line meets horizon = approximately SOUTH

**Verification**: Use pointer stars (Alpha and Beta Centauri) nearby to confirm you found real Southern Cross, not False Cross.

---

### 6. Orion's Belt (Works Both Hemispheres)

**Accuracy**: ±10° (rough but useful)

**Visibility**: Visible from all inhabited continents (seasonal)

**Method:**
- **Northern Hemisphere**: Orion's belt rises in EAST, sets in WEST
- **Southern Hemisphere**: Same
- **Along equator**: Belt passes nearly directly overhead

**Limitations**: Only visible part of the year (winter in Northern Hemisphere, summer in Southern).

---

## Natural Indicators (Use With EXTREME Caution)

**WARNING**: Natural indicators are UNRELIABLE. Use only as supporting evidence, never as primary navigation. Myths are common.

### 7. Moss on Trees (Unreliable Myth)

**Common claim**: "Moss grows on north side of trees"

**Reality**: Moss grows on MOIST, SHADED side
- Could be north in Northern Hemisphere (less sun)
- Could be any direction depending on local conditions
- Affected by wind, rain patterns, nearby water, terrain

**Use**: If you observe moss on multiple trees in same area, it MAY indicate general direction of less sun, but this is weak evidence at best.

---

### 8. Tree Growth Patterns (Slightly More Reliable)

**Observation**: Trees often grow fuller branches on south-facing side (Northern Hemisphere) due to more sunlight.

**Reality**: Affected by:
- Prevailing winds (stronger than sun effect)
- Nearby trees (grow toward gaps)
- Terrain (grow away from slopes)
- Species (some don't show pattern)

**Use**: As very weak supporting evidence only.

---

### 9. Ant Hills (Regional Variation)

**Claim**: Ant hills have steeper slope on north side (Northern Hemisphere)

**Reality**: Sometimes true in specific regions, often false. Depends on ant species, local climate.

**Use**: Don't rely on this.

---

### Natural Navigation Summary

**Most reliable natural indicators:**
1. ⭐ **Sun position** (east, south/noon, west)
2. ⭐ **Star patterns** (Polaris, Southern Cross)
3. ⭐ **Prevailing weather** (if you know local patterns)

**Least reliable:**
- Moss direction
- Tree growth
- Ant hills
- "Natural compasses"

## Terrain Reading (Critical Skill)

### 10. Following Water Downstream

**Principle**: Streams flow to larger streams → rivers → civilization

**When to use**: You're lost, need to reach people, have no other navigation

**How:**
- Find ANY flowing water
- Follow downstream (downhill)
- Eventually reaches larger water bodies (usually with roads/towns)

**Caution:**
- Can be slow (streams meander)
- Terrain along water can be rough (cliffs, thick brush)
- Water crossing risks (don't cross fast/deep water)

**Best practice**: Follow NEAR stream, not IN streambed (easier terrain, can still see/hear water)

---

### 11. Ridgeline Navigation

**Principle**: Ridges provide visibility, easier travel, natural highways

**Advantages:**
- Can see landmarks/terrain
- Usually less vegetation
- Natural drainage (less muddy)
- Better signal for rescue

**Disadvantages:**
- More exposed to weather
- Uses more energy (elevation changes)
- Lightning risk in storms

**Use**: If you know ridge leads toward safety, follow it. If uncertain, ridges are good for scouting.

---

### 12. Terrain Association

**Skill**: Matching visible terrain to mental/physical map

**Key features to identify:**
- Mountain peaks (unique shapes)
- Valleys and drainages
- Ridgelines
- Large rock formations
- Water bodies

**Process:**
1. Climb to high point (safely)
2. Identify 2-3 distinctive landmarks
3. Determine their relationship to each other
4. Match to known geography (if you have rough idea where you are)

---

## Map & Compass Basics

### 13. Reading a Topographic Map

**Key features:**

**Contour lines** (brown lines):
- Connect points of equal elevation
- Close together = steep terrain
- Far apart = gentle slope
- V-shapes pointing uphill = valley/stream
- V-shapes pointing downhill = ridge

**Colors:**
- Green = vegetation (forest)
- White = less vegetation (clearings, alpine)
- Blue = water features
- Brown = elevation contours
- Black = man-made features

**Scale**: Understand distance (e.g., 1:24,000 = 1 inch on map = 2,000 feet on ground)

---

### 14. Using a Compass

**Basic parts:**
- Baseplate (clear plastic)
- Rotating bezel (dial with degrees)
- Magnetic needle (red end points north)
- Direction of travel arrow (on baseplate)
- Orienting arrow (inside bezel)

**Taking a bearing (direction to travel):**

1. **Point direction of travel arrow at your destination**
   - Can be visible landmark or point on map

2. **Rotate bezel until orienting arrow aligns with magnetic needle**
   - Red needle in red "shed"

3. **Read bearing**
   - Number at direction of travel arrow = your bearing in degrees

4. **Walk that bearing**
   - Keep magnetic needle aligned with orienting arrow
   - Follow direction of travel arrow

**Following a bearing:**
- Pick landmark on your bearing line
- Walk to landmark
- Pick next landmark on same bearing
- Repeat

---

### 15. Makeshift Compass (Emergency)

**Magnetize a needle method:**

1. **Magnetize a needle**
   - Rub needle on silk (50+ strokes in same direction)
   - Or rub needle on hair (generates static)
   - Or stroke with magnet if available

2. **Float the needle**
   - Lay needle on leaf/small piece of paper
   - Float in still water (cup, puddle)
   - Needle will slowly align north-south

3. **Determine which end is north**
   - Use sun position (east/west) to figure out north/south
   - Or wait and verify with stars

**Accuracy**: Poor (±20-30°) but better than guessing.

## Getting Un-Lost (When You Realize You're Lost)

### The STOP Principle (Critical)

**S - SIT DOWN**
- Stop moving immediately
- Panic + movement = disaster

**T - THINK**
- When did you last know your location?
- What direction have you traveled?
- What landmarks do you remember?

**O - OBSERVE**
- What do you see/hear?
- Any landmarks, trails, water, signs of people?
- Sun position, time of day?

**P - PLAN**
- Should I stay here (usually yes)?
- If I move, which direction and why (evidence, not guess)?
- How will I mark my location/trail?

---

### Retracing Your Steps

**If you got lost recently (last 30 min):**

1. **Mark current location** (pile of rocks, broken branches)
2. **Think about your path**
   - Which direction did you come from?
   - Any landmarks you remember passing?
3. **Backtrack carefully**
   - Look for your footprints, disturbed vegetation
   - Move slowly
   - Mark your path as you go (can return to this spot)
4. **If you find your trail**
   - Follow it back to known location
5. **If you can't find it after 15 min**
   - Return to marked spot (don't get more lost)
   - STAY PUT

---

### Making Yourself Findable

**If staying put (recommended):**

1. **Stay in open area** (easier for aerial search to spot)
2. **Create ground signals** (see Communication section)
3. **Make noise periodically** (whistle, yell)
4. **Keep fire ready to light** (smoke signal when aircraft heard)
5. **Stay visible** (wear bright colors, reflective materials)

---

## Navigation Tools & Tricks

### Using Shadows Throughout Day

**Principle**: Shadow tips always move west to east

**Quick direction check:**
- Place stick in ground
- Mark shadow tip
- Wait 10 minutes
- Mark new shadow tip
- Line between marks = east-west line

---

### The Stick-in-Ground Sun Arc

**For longer stays, track sun path:**

1. Plant stick vertically
2. Mark shadow tip every hour throughout day
3. Connect marks = curve showing sun's path
4. Shortest shadow = noon = south-facing (Northern Hemisphere)

---

### Navigation by Star Movement

**All stars rotate around Polaris** (Northern Hemisphere):
- Stars rising = east
- Stars setting = west
- Stars moving left = north
- Stars moving right = south

---

## Common Navigation Mistakes

1. **"I'll just go a little further to check"** → Gets more lost
2. **Trusting single navigation method** → Use multiple cross-checks
3. **Traveling at night in unfamiliar terrain** → High injury risk
4. **Ignoring weather signs** → Storm can disorient completely
5. **Not marking trail** → Can't backtrack
6. **Moving when uncertain** → Stay put if rescue is likely
7. **Assuming moss = north** → It doesn't

---

## Key Principles

1. **Stay put if rescue is likely** (80% of scenarios)
2. **Use multiple navigation methods** (cross-check directions)
3. **Move deliberately, mark your trail** (breadcrumb trail)
4. **High ground = visibility** (both for you and searchers)
5. **Water flows to civilization** (but slowly)
6. **Trust celestial navigation** over natural signs (sun, stars >> moss)

**Remember**: Getting un-lost is easier than getting to a destination. If you realize you're off-trail, backtrack immediately. Don't "push through."

---

## Navigation Tools to Carry

**Minimum:**
- Compass (quality, liquid-filled)
- Map of area (topographic)
- Watch (for sun navigation)

**Better:**
- GPS device + batteries (primary)
- Compass + map (backup)
- Whistle (signaling)
- Mirror (signaling + sun sighting)

**Even better:**
- Personal locator beacon (PLB/SPOT device)
- Satellite messenger (InReach, etc.)
