## Recommended Integration Strategy

### Option 1: Extract Illustrations from FM 21-76

**Approach**:
1. Download FM 21-76 PDF from Archive.org
2. Extract relevant illustration pages (Chapter 8)
3. Convert to individual images (PDF → JPG)
4. Store in survival-essentials/images/processing/
5. Reference from food guide

**Pros**: Authoritative source, comprehensive, truly public domain
**Cons**: Manual extraction work, black-and-white only

---

### Option 2: Create Illustrated Processing Guide

**Approach**:
1. Write step-by-step text instructions (already in 05_food.md)
2. Add illustrations from FM 21-76 inline
3. Create visual supplement document

**File structure**:
```
survival-essentials/
├── 05_food.md (text descriptions)
├── 05a_fish_processing_visual_guide.md (with illustrations)
├── 05b_game_processing_visual_guide.md (with illustrations)
└── images/
    └── processing/
        ├── fish_gutting_step1.jpg
        ├── fish_gutting_step2.jpg
        ├── fish_scaling.jpg
        ├── rabbit_skinning.jpg
        ├── squirrel_gutting.jpg
        └── smoking_setup.jpg
```

**Pros**: Organized, scannable, offline-accessible
**Cons**: More files to maintain

---

### Option 3: Hybrid - Link to FM 21-76 + Critical Images ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Approach**:
1. Store 5-10 critical processing images in repo
2. Link to full FM 21-76 PDF for comprehensive reference

## Extraction Instructions

### From FM 21-76 PDF

**Manual method**:
1. Download PDF from Archive.org
2. Open in PDF reader (Adobe, Preview, etc.)
3. Navigate to Chapter 8 (Food Procurement)
4. Screenshot or extract illustration pages
5. Crop to individual diagrams
6. Save as JPEG (~150-200KB each)
7. Store in survival-essentials/images/processing/

**Command-line method** (if you have ImageMagick):
```bash
# Extract specific pages from PDF
pdftk FM21-76_SurvivalManual.pdf cat 180-220 output chapter8_food.pdf

# Convert pages to images
convert -density 150 chapter8_food.pdf -quality 85 page_%03d.jpg

# Rename and organize
mv page_015.jpg fish_gutting.jpg
mv page_018.jpg rabbit_skinning.jpg
# etc.
```

**Python script** (automated extraction):
```python
# extract_fm21_illustrations.py
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
from pathlib import Path

# Download FM 21-76 first
pdf_path = "FM21-76_SurvivalManual.pdf"
output_dir = Path("survival-essentials/images/processing")
output_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Extract specific pages (adjust page numbers based on your PDF)
pages_to_extract = {
    180: "fish_gutting.jpg",
    182: "fish_scaling.jpg",
    185: "rabbit_skinning.jpg",
    188: "smoking_setup.jpg",
}

for page_num, filename in pages_to_extract.items():
    images = convert_from_path(pdf_path, first_page=page_num, last_page=page_num)
    images[0].save(output_dir / filename, 'JPEG')
    print(f"Extracted {filename}")
```

## Image Formatting Guidelines

**For repo storage**:
- Format: JPEG (smaller than PNG)
- Resolution: 1200-1600px wide (readable on phone/tablet)
- Compression: 75-85% quality
- Naming: `technique_step.jpg` (e.g., `fish_gutting_step1.jpg`)
- Target size: <200KB per image

**Optimization**:
- Use ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or jpegoptim
- Remove metadata (EXIF data)
- Convert to grayscale if originally B&W (smaller file)

## Companion Text (Already in 05_food.md)

The visual guides complement existing text in 05_food.md:

**Fish Preparation** (lines 170-176):
```markdown
1. Gut immediately: Cut from anus to gills, remove organs
2. Scale or skin: Scrape scales off or skin (catfish, bullhead)
3. Cook thoroughly: Parasites common in wild fish
4. Preserve excess: Smoke, salt, or dry
```

**Processing Game** (lines 220-233):
```markdown
Small game (rabbit, squirrel):
1. Skin (peel like removing a shirt)
2. Gut (remove all organs)
3. Remove head, feet
4. Cook immediately or preserve

Never eat:
- Brain, spinal tissue (prion diseases)
- Organs (liver can be toxic)
- Sick-looking animals (lesions, discolored organs)

Cook thoroughly: Parasites and bacteria common
```

**Add visual references**:
```markdown
See [Fish Processing Visual Guide](05a_fish_processing_visual_guide.md) for illustrated step-by-step instructions.

See [Game Processing Visual Guide](05b_game_processing_visual_guide.md) for illustrated techniques.
